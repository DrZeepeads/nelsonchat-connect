Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders PART Chapter 32 Psychosocial Assessment and Psychiatric Diagnostic Evaluation Heather J. Walter It is estimated that 20% of children living in the United States experi- ence a mental illness in a given year; mental illness is more prevalent than leukemia, diabetes, and AIDS combined. More money is spent on mental disorders than on any other childhood illness, including asthma, trauma, and infectious diseases. Although nearly one in five youths suffers from a psychiatric disorder, 75-85% do not receive specialty mental health services; rather most services are delivered in nonspecialty sectors (primary care, schools, child welfare, juvenile jus- tice), where mental health expertise may be limited. Untreated or inad- equately treated psychiatric disorders persist over decades, become increasingly intractable to treatment, impair adherence to medical treatment regimens, and incur progressively greater social, educa- tional, and economic consequences over time. AIMS OF PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT IN THE PEDIATRIC SETTING A psychosocial assessment in the pediatric setting should determine whether there are signs and symptoms of cognitive, developmental, emotional, behavioral, or social difficulties and characterize those signs and symptoms sufficiently to determine their appropriate management. The focus of the assessment varies with the nature of the presenting problem and the clinical setting. Under emergency circumstances, the focus may be limited to an assessment of "dangerousness to self or oth- ers" for the purpose of determining the safest level of care. In routine circumstances (well-child visits), the focus may be broader, involving a screen for symptoms, distress, and functional impairment in the major psychosocial domains. The challenge for the pediatric practitioner will be to determine as accurately as possible whether the presenting signs and symptoms are likely to meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder and whether the severity and complexity of the disorder suggest referral to a mental health specialist or management in the primary care setting. PRESENTING PROBLEMS Infants may come to clinical attention because of problems with eating and/or sleep regulation, concerns about failure to gain weight, poor social responsiveness, limited vocalization, apathy or disinterest, and my angered ung this petro aye rumination and reactive attachment disorders. Toddlers are assessed for concerns about sleep problems, lan- guage delay, motor hyperactivity, extreme misbehavior, extreme shyness, inflexible adherence to routines, difficulty separating from parents, struggles over toilet training, dietary issues, and testing lim- its. Developmental delays and more subtle physiologic, sensory, and motor processing problems can be presented as concerns. Problems with "goodness of fit" between the child's temperament and the par- ents' expectations can create relationship difficulties that also require assessment (see Chapter 19). Mental health disorders most commonly diagnosed during this period are developmental delays, autism spec- trum disorder (ASD) and reactive attachment disorders. Presenting problems in preschoolers include elimination difficul- ties, sibling jealousy, difficulty forming friendships, self-destructive impulsiveness, multiple fears, nightmares, refusal to follow directions, rigidity, somatization, speech that is difficult to understand, and tem- per tantrums. Mental health disorders most commonly diagnosed in this period are ASD, communication, oppositional, attention-deficit/ hyperactivity (ADHD), anxiety (separation, selective mutism), reactive attachment, and sleep disorders. Older children are brought to clinical attention because of concerns about angry or sad mood, bed-wetting, overactivity, impulsiveness, distractibility, learning problems, arguing, defiance, nightmares, school refusal, bullying or being bullied, worries and fears, somatization, com- munication problems, tics, and withdrawal or isolation. Mental health disorders most commonly diagnosed during this period are ADHD, oppositional, anxiety (phobias), elimination, somatic symptom, spe- cific learning, and tic disorders. Adolescents are assessed for concerns about the family situation, experimentation with sexuality and drugs, delinquency and gang involvement, friendship patterns, issues of independence, identity formation, self-esteem, and morality. Mental health disorders most often diagnosed during this period are anxiety (panic, social anxiety), depressive, bipolar, psychotic, obsessive-compulsive, impulse control, conduct, substance-related, and eating disorders. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVIEW Psychosocial interviewing in the context of a routine pediatric visit requires adequate time and privacy. The purpose of this line of inquiry should be explained to the child and parents ("to make sure things are going OK at home, at school, and with friends"), along with the limits of confidentiality. Thereafter, the first goal of the interview is to build rapport with both the child and the parents (see Chapters 18 and 34 for further discussion of strategies for engaging families). With the parents, this rapport is grounded in respect for the parents® knowledge of their child, their role as the central influence in their child's life, and their desire to make a better life for their child. Parents often feel anxious or guilty because they believe that problems a child is experiencing imply that their parenting skills are inadequate. Parents experiences of their own childhood influence the meaning a parent places on a child's feelings and behavior. A good working alliance allows mutual discovery of the past as it is active in the present and permits potential distortions to be modified more readily. Developmentally appropriate overtures can facilitate rapport with the child. Examples include playing peek-a-boo with an infant, racing toy cars with a preschooler, commenting on sports with a child who is wearing a baseball cap, and discussing music with a teenager who is wearing a rock band T-shirt. After an overture with the child, it is helpful to begin with family- centered interviewing, in which the parent is invited to present any psychosocial concerns (learning, feelings, behavior, peer relationships) about the child. With adolescent patients, it is important to conduct a separate interview to give the adolescent an opportunity to confirm or refute the parent's presentation and to present the problem from his or her perspective. Following the family's undirected presentation of the primary problem, it is important to shift to direct questioning to clarify the duration, frequency, and severity of symptoms, associated distress or functional impairment, and the developmental and environmental context in which the symptoms occur. Because of the high degree of comorbidity of psychosocial prob- lems in children, after eliciting the presenting problem, the pediatric practitioner should then briefly screen for problems in all the major

This can be preceded by a transition statement such as, "Now I'd like to ask about some other issues that I discuss with all parents and kids. Have there been any problems with attention, learning, behavior, sad mood..." etc. A useful guide for this area of inquiry is provided by the 11 Action Signs (Table 32.1), designed to give frontline clinicians the tools needed to recognize early symptoms of mental disorders. Functional impairment can be assessed by inquiring about symptoms and function in the major life domains, including home and family, school, peers, and community. These domains are included in the HEADSS (Home, Education, Activities, Drugs, Sexuality, Suicide/Depression) Interview Guide, often used in the screening of adolescents (Table 32.2). The nature and severity of the presenting problem(s) can be fur- ther characterized through a standardized self-, parent-, or teacher- informant symptom rating scale; Table 32.3 lists selected scales in the public domain. A rating scale is a type of measure that provides a relatively rapid assessment of a specific construct with an easily derived numerical score that is readily interpreted. The use of symptom rating scales can ensure efficient, systematic coverage of relevant symptoms, quantify symptom severity, and document a baseline against which treatment effects can be measured. Functional impairment also can be assessed with self- and other-reported rating scales. Clinical experience and methodologic studies suggest that parents and teachers are more likely than the child to report externalizing problems (disruptive, impulsive, overactive, or antisocial behavior). Children may be more likely to report anxious or depressive feel- ings, including suicidal thoughts and acts, of which the parents may be unaware. Discrepancies across informants are common and can shed light on whether the symptoms are pervasive or contextual. Although concerns have been raised about children's competence as self-reporters (because of limitations in linguistic skills, self-reflection, emotional awareness, ability to monitor behavior, thoughts, and feel- ings, tendency toward social desirability), children and adolescents can both be reliable and valid self-reporters. Pediatric practitioners are encouraged to become familiar with the psychometric characteristics and appropriate use of at least one gen- eral (broad-band) psychosocial screening instrument, such as the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)* or the Pediatric Symp- tom Checklist (PSC)† to identify potential mental health problems. If the clinical interview or broad-band symptom rating scale suggests difficulties in one or more specific symptom areas, the clinician can follow with a psychometrically sound, corresponding narrow-band * http://www.sdqinfo.org/py/sdqinfo/b0.py. thttp://www.brightfutures.org/mentalhealth/pdf/professionals/ped_sympton_chklst.pdf.

Children and adolescents scoring above focused symptom rating scale cutpoints in most cases should undergo a mental health assess- ment, because scores above cutpoints are highly correlated with clini- cally significant psychiatric disorders. Youths scoring just below or only slightly above cutpoints may be appropriate for preventive intervention (anticipatory guidance) in the pediatric primary care setting. Youths scoring moderately above cutpoints for disorders commonly present- ing in pediatric primary care (e.g., anxiety, depression, ADHD) may be appropriate for treatment in primary care. Youths scoring greatly above cutpoints for anxiety, depression, and ADHD, or youths presenting with symptoms of psychiatric disorders nearly always characterized by severity and complexity (e.g., bipolar, psychotic, obsessive-compulsive,

The interview should sensitively assess whether the child has been exposed to any frightening events, including abuse, neglect, bullying, marital discord, or domestic or community violence; whether the child shows any indication of dangerousness to self or others or a severely altered mental status (psychosis, intoxication, delirium, rage, hopelessness); or whether the child (if age appropriate) has been involved in any risky behav- ior, including running away, staying out without permission, tru- ancy, gang involvement, experimentation with substances, and unprotected sexual encounters. The interview also should assess the capacity of the parents to adequately provide for the child's physi- cal, emotional, and social needs or whether parental capacity has been diminished by psychiatric disorder, family dysfunction, or the sequelae of disadvantaged socioeconomic status. Any indications of threats to the child's safety should be immediately followed by thor- ough assessment and protective action. DIAGNOSIS There is variability in the level of confidence pediatric practitio- ners perceive in diagnosing mental health problems in children and adolescents in accordance with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria. Pediatric practitioners who have familiarity with psychiatric diagnostic criteria may feel confident diagnosing certain disorders, particularly the more common neuro- developmental, elimination, and eating disorders (ADHD, anxiety, autism spectrum, tics, enuresis, encopresis, anorexia).

While focusing on the specific psychiatric manifestations and and medication use [Tables 32.4 and 32.5]) producing psychiatric symptoms. Disease-specific therapy combined with psychopharma- cology is often necessary when a systemic disorder is identified. PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION The objectives of the psychiatric diagnostic evaluation of the child and adolescent, generally conducted by a behavioral health specialist, are to determine whether psychopathology or developmental risk is pres- ent and if so, to establish an explanatory formulation and a differen- tial diagnosis, and to determine whether treatment is indicated and, if so, to develop a treatment plan and facilitate the parents' and child's involvement in the plan. The aims of the diagnostic evaluation are to clarify the reasons for the referral, to obtain an accurate accounting of the child's developmental functioning and the nature and extent of the child's psychosocial difficulties, functional impairment, and subjective distress, and to identify potential individual, family, or environmental factors that might account for, influence, or ameliorate these difficul- ties. The issues relevant to diagnosis and treatment planning can span genetic, constitutional, and temperamental factors, individual psy- chodynamics, cognitive, language, and social skills, family patterns of interaction and child-rearing practices, and community, school, and socioeconomic influences.

Chapter 32 • Psychosocial Assessment and Psychiatric Diagnostic Evaluation 221 The focus of the evaluation is developmental; it seeks to describe the child's functioning in various realms and to assess the child's adaptation in these areas relative to that expected for the child's age and phase of development. The developmental perspec- tive extends beyond current difficulties to vulnerabilities that can affect future development and as such are important targets for preventive intervention. Vulnerabilities may include subthreshold or subsyndromal difficulties that, especially when manifold, often are accompanied by significant distress or impairment and as such are important as potential harbingers of future problems. Throughout the assessment, the clinician focuses on identify- ing a realistic balance of vulnerabilities and strengths in the child, in the parents, and in the parent-child interactions. From this strength-based approach, over time a hopeful family narrative is co-constructed to frame the child's current developmental progress and predict the child's ongoing progress within the scope of current risk and protective factors. As described earlier a psychiatric assessment conducted by a pediatric primary care practitioner generally will be a brief psy- chosocial assessment focused on obtaining sufficient information to triage the case to the appropriate level of care. A brief assess- ment can comprise both administration of a focused (narrow-band) symptom rating scale to assess symptom severity and a focused clinical interview. The focused clinical interview can comprise four dimensions: history (onset, duration, response to prior treatment, family history), severity (as derived from the focused rating scale and verbal query about the degree of distress and/or impairment associated with the symptom[s]), complexity (brief review of psy- chiatric comorbidities and medical or social complexities), and safety (ascertainment of imminent and substantial risk of harm). With this information, the pediatrician can provisionally diagnose the case and triage the case to primary care (for preventive inter- vention or treatment of mild to moderate presentations of common disorders [e.g., ADHD, anxiety, depression]), or to specialty behav- ioral healthcare (for severe presentations of these disorders or for other psychiatric disorders nearly always characterized by severity and complexity). In the specialty care setting, although the scope of the evaluation will vary with the clinical setting (e.g., emergency room vs medical floor vs psychiatric clinic), a comprehensive psychiatric diagnos- tic evaluation typically has 12 major components: • Presenting problems) and the context in which they occur • Review of psychiatric symptoms • History of psychiatric treatment • Medical history : Develonal tat hitory • Family history • Mental status examination • Biopsychosocial clinical formulation : Risk ase mation (DSM-5) diagnosis • Treatment plan For infants and young children, the presenting problem and his- torical information is derived from parents and other informants. As children mature, they become increasingly important con- tributors to the information base, and they become the primary source of information in later adolescence. Information relevant to formulation and differential diagnosis is derived in multiple ways, including directive and nondirective questioning, interactive play, and observation of the child alone and together with the caregiver (s). The explication of the presenting problems) includes infor- mation about onset, duration, frequency, setting, and severity of symptoms, associated distress and/or functional impairment, and predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and ameliorating contex- tual factors. The symptom review assesses potential comorbidity in the major domains of child and adolescent psychopathology. The history of psychiatric treatment includes gathering information about prior emergency mental health assessments, psychiatric hos- pitalizations, day treatment, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and nontraditional treatments. The medical history includes information about the source of primary care, the frequency of health supervision, past and current medical illnesses and treatments, and the youth and family's history of adherence to medical treatment. A systematic review of organ or functional systems facilitates the identification of abnormalities that require investigation or monitoring by the pediatric practitioner, as well as the identification of cautionary factors related to the prescrip- tion of psychotropic medication. The developmental history includes information about the circumstances of conception, pregnancy, or adoption, pre-, peri-, or postnatal insults, attachment and tempera- ment, cognitive, motor, linguistic, emotional, social, and moral devel- opment, health habits, sexuality, substance use (as age appropriate), coping and defensive structure, future orientation, and song a The enscat sta hise, fy ture orientation, ate pet tied cal grades, attendance, behavior, classroom accommodations, special education services, disciplinary actions, social relationships, extracur- ricular activities, and barriers to learning. The family history assesses family composition, sociodemographic and neighborhood character- istics, domiciliary arrangements, parenting capacities, family function, medical/psychiatric histories of family members, and cultural/religious The mental status examination assesses appearance, relatedness, cognition, communication, mood, affective expression, behavior, memory, orientation, and perception. The comprehensive psychiatric evaluation culminates in a biopsy- chosocial formulation, diagnosis, and risk assessment. The biopsy- chosocial formulation is derived from an assessment of vulnerabilities and strengths in the biologic, psychologic, and social domains and serves to identify targets for intervention and treatment. In the bio- logic domain, major vulnerabilities include a family history of psychi- atric disorder as well as a personal history of pre-, peri-, or postnatal insults, cognitive or linguistic impairments, chronic physical illness, and a difhcult temperament. In the psychologic domain, major vul- nerabilities include failure to achieve developmental tasks, unre- solved unconscious conflicts, and maladaptive coping and defensive styles. In the social domain, major vulnerabilities include parental incapacity, unskilled parenting, family dysfunction, social isolation, inadequate school setting, absence of supportive community struc- tures, and sociodemographic disadvantage. Major strengths include cognitive and linguistic capability, physical health and vigor, stable, moderate temperamental characteristics, and stable supportive par- enting, family, peer, and community structures. The biopsychosocial formulation can be organized to reflect predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and protective (ameliorating) factors (the "4 Ps") influ- encing the development of the observed psychopathology. The diagnosis is made in accordance with the nomenclature in DSM-5. This nomenclature categorizes cross-sectional phenom- enology into discrete clinical syndromes and seeks to improve diagnostic accuracy at the expense of theories of causation. By DSM-5 convention, if diagnostic criteria are met, the diagnosis is given (except where hierarchical rules apply); consequently, psychi- atric comorbidity is a common occurrence. The risk assessment includes a careful assessment of risk status, including suicidality, homicidality, assaultiveness, self-injuriousness, acute mental status changes, and involvement in risky behavior or situations. The comprehensive psychiatric diagnostic evaluation culmi- nates in a treatment plan that brings the broad array of targeted interventions to the service of the child. Diagnoses drive the choice of evidence-based psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic treatments. The formulation drives the selection of interventions targeted at biologic, psychologic, and social vulnerabilities and strengths. Many of these treatments and interventions are described in the succeeding chapters. 

222 Part III • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION OF INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN Evaluation of infants and young children with challenging behaviors includes the domains of physiology, temperament, language and motor development, affective behavior, social behavior, and communication. Although much of the information in these domains will be derived from parent report, much also can be gleaned from nonverbal behavior and observation of the parent-child interaction. Observations should include predominant affective tone of parent and child (positive, negative, apa- thetic), involvement in the situation (curiosity, disinterest), social respon- siveness (mutuality of gaze, auditory responsiveness), and reactions to transitions (including separation). A screen for maternal depression* is critical at this stage, as is an assess- ment of the mother's (or other caregivers) ability to respond rapidly on a contingent basis to the child's expressed needs, regulate the child's rapid shifts of emotion and behavior, and provide a stimulus shelter to prevent the child from being overwhelmed. Standardized screening instruments (Ages and Stages Questionnaires, Brief Infant-Toddler Social & Emotional Assessment, Early Childhood Screening Assessment, Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Par- ents' Evaluation of Developmental Status, and Survey of Well-being of Young Children) designed for this age-group can be helpful in systematiz- ing the evaluation. In addition, the Infant, Toddler and Preschool Mental Status Exam (ITP-MSE) is a reference tool that describes how traditional categories of the mental status examination can be adapted to observa- tions of young children. Additional categories, including sensory and state regulation, have been added that reflect important areas of development in young children. Diagnostic systems that are more age appropriate than DSM-5 have been developed for infants and young children. These systems include the Research Diagnostic Criteria-Preschool Age (RDC-PA) and Zero to Three Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmen- tal Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood-Revised (DC: 0-3R). The DC: 0-3R includes a relationship classification that assesses the range of interactional adaptation in each parent-child relationship and regu- lation disorders of sensory processing that identify a range of consti- tutionally and maturationally based sensory reactivity patterns, motor patterns, and behavior patterns that together can dysregulate a child internally and impact the child's interactions with caregivers.

Chapter 33 Psychopharmacology David R. DeMaso and Heather J. Walter Psychopharmacology is the first-line treatment for several child and adolescent mental health disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactiv- ity [ADHD], schizophrenia spectrum, and bipolar disorders) and is used adjunctively with psychosocial treatments for other disorders (or comorbid conditions), including anxiety, depressive, autism spectrum, trauma-related, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Before prescribing a psychotropic medication, primary care practitioners (PCPs) should review full prescribing information for each medication (in package inserts or at reliable websites such as the National Institutes of Health DailyMed*) to obtain complete and up-to-date information about indi- cations, contraindications, warnings, interactions, and precautions. * https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/index.cfm. It is helpful for PCPs to be guided by principles for effective use of psychotropic medications in their medication assessment and manage- ment (Table 33.1). These principles involve a series of interconnected steps, including conducting a focused behavioral health assessment, establishing target symptoms) and appropriate level of care, deciding on a medication and a monitoring plan, obtaining treatment assent/ consent, and implementing treatment. In following this approach, PCPs are well positioned to provide safe and effective first-line psy- chopharmacology for common mental health conditions (e.g., ADHD, anxiety, depression) with moderate symptom presentations. Severe/ complex presentations likely are better served through consultation with and/or referral to a behavioral health specialist. Questions remain about the quality of the evidence supporting the use of many psychotropic medications in children and adolescents. In general, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms are targets for medication treatment when (1) there is no or insufficient response to available evidence-based psychosocial interventions, (2) the patient's symptoms are severe and the patient is experiencing significant distress or functional impairment, and/or (3) the patient's symptoms convey significant risk of harm. Common target symptoms include agita- tion, aggression, anxiety, depression, mania, hyperactivity, inattention, impulsivity, obsessions, compulsions, and psychosis (Table 33.2). All these symptoms can be quantitatively measured with standardized rat- ing scales to establish baseline symptom severity and facilitate "treating to target." STIMULANTS AND OTHER ADHD MEDICATIONS Stimulants are sympathomimetic drugs that act both in the central ner- vous system (CNS) and peripherally by enhancing dopaminergic and noradrenergic transmission (Table 33.3). Strong evidence (approxi- mate effect size 1.00, large) exists for the effectiveness of these medi- cations for the treatment of ADHD (Chapter 50); stimulants also are eftective for the management of aggression. In some cases, stimulants have been used as monotherapy for fatigue or malaise associated with chronic physical illnesses. No major differences in efficacy or tolerability have been found between different classes of stimulants, and no consistent patient pro- file identifies those who will respond preferentially to one class over another. The most common (generally dose-dependent) side effects of stimulants include headache, stomachache, appetite suppression, weight loss, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate increases, and delayed sleep onset. Less common side effects include irritability (more promi- nent in younger children), aggression, social withdrawal, and rarely, hallucinations (visual or tactile). Stimulants have been associated with elevations in mean BP (<5 mm Hg) and pulse (<10 beats/min); a subset of individuals (5-10%) may have greater increases. The rate of sudden death in pediatric patients taking stimulants is comparable to children in the general population; the hazard ratio for serious cardiovascular (CV) events is 0.75 (although up to a twofold increase in risk could not be ruled out). Moreover, a case series analysis of children with a CV incident and treatment with methylphenidate demonstrated an increased risk of arrhythmia (inci- dence rate ratio, 1.61) that was highest in the presence of congenital heart disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recom- mends that stimulants should be avoided in the presence of structural cardiac abnormalities (e.g., postoperative tetralogy of Fallot, coronary artery abnormalities, subaortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopa- thy) and patient symptoms (syncope, palpitations, arrhythmias) or family history (e.g., unexplained sudden death) suggestive of CV dis- ease. In these circumstances, cardiology consultation is recommended before prescribing. Routine electrocardiograms (ECGs) are not recom- mended in the absence of cardiac risk factors. The a-adrenergic agents clonidine and guanfacine are presynap- tic adrenergic agonists that appear to stimulate inhibitory presynaptic autoreceptors in the CNS (see Table 33.3). The extended release formu- lations of both agents have FDA approval for ADHD. The extended- release formulation of guanfacine has strong evidence (approximate effect size 0.80, large) for the monotherapy of ADHD. Extended- release guanfacine also has moderate evidence for effective treatment 

Chapter 33 • Psychopharmacology 223 Table 33.1 Principles for Effective Use of Psychotropic Medications • Identify potential target symptoms using broad mental health screening instruments (e.g., Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17)) • Conduct focused behavioral health (BH) assessment to establish target symptoms and appropriate level of care • Focused symptom rating scales, e.g., • Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) • Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) • Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scales • Swanson Nolan and Pelham-IV-26 (SNAP-IV-26) • Focused clinical interview to determine symptom history, severity (from focused rating scale score), complexity (psychiatric comorbidities, medical or psychosocial complexity), and safety (imminent risk of substantial harm) • If insufficient information is available to render a precise diagnosis for a symptom cluster, consider applying Unspecified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) psychiatric diagnosis • Rule out alternative explanations (medical, medication, substance, or developmental "masqueraders") for target symptoms (may require specialty referral) • Establish appropriate level of care based upon findings from focused BH assessment • Rule out relative or absolute contraindications to medication use, e.g., • Medical conditions • Drug interactions : obit no motior fee sion able conte/or diantate at rese din antiso cito behavior • Counsel about factors potentially contributing to symptom presentation or affecting response to medication • Inadequate nutrition, physical activity, sleep, recreation, stress management; substance use • Consider response to previous medication trials • Favorable and adverse effects • Develop comprehensive treatment plan as indicated • Psychotherapy and/or medication • Obtain and/med consent from parent/guardian and assent from patient • Nature of the condition needing treatment • Nature and purpose of proposed treatment and the probability that it will succeed • Risks and benefits of the proposed treatment : Prognosis with and opose the proment di treater attendant risks and beneits • Select evidence-based medication and prescribe an adequate dose for an adequate duration; whenever possible, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for the given indication should be prioritized : Tonse to efective to berated dese within each ishic dos to arieve maximum effect • "Start low, go slow" • Explain details of medication management • Name of medication • When to administer • Who should administer (e.g., parent, older teen) • How to administer (e.g., with food, swallowed whole) • Time to onset • Duration of action • How to store medication • Review of side effects and what to do if each should occur • How response to medication will be monitored (e.g., focused symptom rating scales, height/weight, pulse/blood pressure, side effect checks) • Special safety instructions (e.g., suicidal thoughts, severe agitation) Coming near like with adope Medication ida such as hose found a hates / al mad hin go daily medinda, dim • Monitor medication compliance and physical/laboratory parameters as indicated • Monitor response to treatment • Periodic readministration of focused symptom rating scale(s); adjust dose as indicated to achieve remission • Taper and discontinue ineffective medication before substituting alternative medication, or have clear rationale for using medication combinations • Plan for medication discontinuation after symptom-free and high-functioning interval of ADHD with comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), favor- ably affecting both symptom clusters, as well as for the treatment of agitation in autism. Sedation, somnolence, headache, abdominal pain, hypotension, bra- dycardia, cardiac conduction abnormalities, dry mouth, depression, and confusion are potential side effects of clonidine and guanfacine. Abrupt withdrawal can result in rebound hypertension; overdose can result in bradycardia and hypotension leading to hospitalization or death. Atomoxetine is a selective inhibitor of presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake that increases dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex (see Table 33.3). It is less effective for the treatment of ADHD (approximate effect size 0.60, medium) than stimulants, but atomoxetine has a longer duration of action (approximately 24 hours). Atomoxetine can have an onset of action within 1-2 weeks of starting treatment, but there is an incrementally increasing response for up to 4-6 weeks or longer. Common side effects include nausea, headache, abdominal pain, insomnia, somnolence, erectile dysfunction, irritability, fatigue,

Potential serious neuropsychiatric reac- tions include psychosis, mania, panic attacks, aggressive behavior, depression, seizures, and suicidal thinking. Atomoxetine carries an FDA warning regarding the risk of suicidal thinking and the need to monitor this closely. Atomoxetine also has been associated with rare hepatotoxic- ity and should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury, and should not be restarted. Because of the risk of sudden death, atomoxetine generally should be avoided in youth with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems. Viloxazine is a second selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that was approved for ADHD by the FDA in 2021. It has once daily dos- ing, reaches steady state by day 2, and has a similar side effect profile to atomoxetine (including FDA warnings on suicidality and increases in heart rate and blood pressure). ANTIDEPRESSANTS Antidepressant drugs act on presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors affecting the release and reuptake of brain neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine (Table 33.4). There is mod- erate evidence for the effectiveness of antidepressant medications in the treatment of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders (approxi- mate effect size 0.70, medium) and weaker evidence for the treatment of depressive disorders (approximate effect size 0.30, small). Suicidal thoughts have been reported during treatment with all antidepressants. The overall risk difference of suicidal thoughts/behaviors across ran- domized controlled trials (RCTs) of all antidepressants and all indica- tions has been reported as 0.7%, corresponding to a number needed to harm of 143. All antidepressants carry an FDA warning for suicidality; careful monitoring is recommended during the initial stages of treat- ment and following dose adjustments. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine out- performs all other antidepressants (both SSRI and non-SSRI) studied and is the only SSRI separating from placebo in studies of depressed preadolescents. Side effects to SSRIs generally manifest in the first few weeks of treatment, and many will resolve with time. More common side effects include nausea, irritability, insomnia, appetite changes, weight loss/gain, headaches, dry mouth, dizziness, bruxism, diapho- resis, tremors, akathisia, and restlessness. A small proportion of youth taking S5Rls, particularly younger children, develop behavioral acti- vation (motor or mental restlessness, increased impulsivity, disin- hibited behavior, talkativeness, insomnia) that can be confused with mania, but the activation symptoms typically resolve when the dose is decreased or the medication discontinued. Because the likelihood of activation events has been associated with higher antidepressant plasma levels, slow up-titration and close monitoring (particularly in younger children) is warranted and underscores the importance of educating parents/guardians and patients in advance about this poten- tial side effect. Sexual side effects are common, including decreased libido, anor- gasmia, and erectile dysfunction. There is an increased risk of bleeding, especially when used with aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). SRIs can be associated with abnormal heart rhythms, and cita- lopram causes dose-dependent QT interval prolongation, contrain- dicating doses >40 mg/day. Patients with diabetes may experience hypoglycemia during SSRI treatment and hyperglycemia on discontin- uation. Discontinuation symptoms (e.g., dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances, anxiety, contusion, head- ache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania) are common with short-acting SSRIs (sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram), leading to a recommendation for divided doses if these medications are used at higher doses and graduated reduction if discontinued. Serotonin syndrome results from excessive agonism of the CNS and peripheral nervous system serotonergic receptors and can be caused by prescribing multiple serotonergic medications concomitantly (Chap- ter 94). Symptoms can arise within 24-48 hours and are characterized by mental status changes (confusion, agitation, anxiety), neuromus- cular hyperactivity (tremors, clonus, hyperreflexia, muscle rigidity), and autonomic hyperactivity (hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, tachypnea, diaphoresis, shivering, vomiting, diarrhea). Advanced symptoms include fever, seizures, arrhythmias, and unconsciousness, which can lead to fatalities. Treatment is hospital based and includes discontinuation of all serotonergic agents and supportive care with con- tinuous cardiac monitoring. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) play a role in most cases of serotonin syndrome and should be avoided in combination with any other serotonergic drug, including another MAOI. Moreover, caution should be exercised when combining two or more non-MAOI serotonergic drugs, including antidepressants, opi- oids and other pain medications, stimulants, cough/cold/allergy medi- cations, and other over-the-counter products. Caution entails starting the second non-MAOI serotonergic drug at a low dose, increasing the dose slowly, and monitoring for symptoms, especially in the first 24-48 hours after dosage changes. Adolescents should be informed that cer- tain recreational drugs (e.g., dextromethorphan, "ecstasy") are highly serotonergic and can cause serious interactions with antidepressants. The non-SSRI antidepressants include duloxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, and mirtazapine (see Table 33.4). These medications all lack rigorous evidence to support their effectiveness in children and adolescents and as such should not be considered first-line options. Duloxetine and venlafaxine are serotonin-norepinephrine reup- take inhibitors (SNRIs). Duloxetine has FDA approval for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in children and adolescents but typi- cally is not as effective for anxiety as the SSRIs. Studies of duloxetine for depression in youth have been negative. There is some evidence in adults that duloxetine can be useful for fibromyalgia and chronic mus- culoskeletal pain, an effect that has also been observed in children and adolescents. Common side effects of duloxetine include nausea, diar- rhea, decreased weight, and dizziness. Increases in heart rate and BP have been noted; BP should be monitored at each visit and with each dosage change. In addition, there have been reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal; duloxetine should be discontinued and not resumed in patients who develop jaundice or other evidence of liver dysfunc- tion. Duloxetine also has been associated with severe skin reactions (erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome).

No rigorous studies of bupro- pion for anxiety or depression have been conducted with children or adolescents, although some evidence suggests that bupropion may be effective for smoking cessation and ADHD in youth. Common side effects include irritability, nausea, anorexia, headache, and insomnia. Dose-related seizures (0.1% risk at 300 mg/day and 0.4% risk at 400 mg/day) have occurred with bupropion, so it is contraindicated in those with epilepsy, eating disorders, or at risk for seizures. Venlafaxine has only negative trials for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents but does have some favorable evidence for the treatment of anxiety. Side effects are similar to SSRIs, including hypertension, irritability, insomnia, headaches, anorexia, nervousness, and dizziness, and dropout rates are high in clinical trials of venlafax- ine. BP should be monitored at each visit and with each dosage change. Discontinuation symptoms are more pronounced with venlafaxine than the other non-SSRI antidepressants. In addition, suicidal thinking and agitation may be more common with venlafaxine than with other antidepressants, requiring close monitoring. In light of the substantial adverse effects, venlafaxine likely should be considered to be a third- line medication. Mirtazapine is both a noradrenergic and a specific serotonergic antidepressant. Mirtazapine has only negative trials for the treat- ment of depression in youth and has no rigorous evidence of effec- tiveness for any other child or adolescent psychiatric disorder. Mirtazapine is associated with a risk for substantial weight gain and, more rarely, hypotension, elevated liver enzymes, agranulocytosis, and QT prolongation. Although its sedating properties have led to its adjunctive use for insomnia in adults with depressive/anxiety disorders, there is no evidence for use of mirtazapine in childhood sleep disorders. The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have mixed mechanisms of action; for example, clomipramine is primarily serotonergic, and imip- ramine is both noradrenergic and serotonergic. With the advent of the SSRIs, the lack of efficacy studies, particularly in depression, and more serious side effects, the use of TCAs in children and adolescents has substantially declined. Clomipramine has been used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (see Table 33.4). TCAs also have been used for neuropathic pain. TCAs cause both blood pressure and heart rate increases and are class I antiarrhythmics with quinidine-like prop- erties that are potentially fatal in overdose. Anticholinergic symptoms (e.g., dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation) are the most common side effects. Anxiolytic agents, including lorazepam, clonazepam, and hydroxy- zine, have been effectively used for the short-term relief of the symp- toms of acute anxiety (see Table 33.4). They are less effective as chronic (>4 months) anxiolytic medications, particularly when used as mono- therapy. Chronic use carries a significant risk of physical and psycho- logic dependence. ANTIPSYCHOTICS Based on their mechanism of action, antipsychotic medications can be divided into first-generation (blocking dopamine D, receptors) and second-generation (mixed dopaminergic and serotonergic antago- nists) agents (Table 33.5). The second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have relatively strong antagonistic interactions with 5-HT, receptors and perhaps more variable activity at central adrenergic, cholinergic, and hista- minic sites, which might account for the varying side effects, particu- larly metabolic, noted among these agents. The SGAs have moderate evidence for the treatment of agitation in autism and for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and aggression. Haloperidol is a

The antipsychotic agents have significant side effects, including sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperprolactinemia, anticho- linergic, seizures, orthostasis, CV effects, weight gain, hyperlip- idemia, metabolic syndrome, glucose abnormalities, hematologic effects (e.g., leukopenia, neutropenia), and elevated liver transami- nases (Table 33.6). They have an FDA warning for increased risk of diabetes. Youth appear to be more sensitive to sedation, extra- pyramidal side effects (except akathisia), withdrawal dyskinesia, prolactin abnormalities, weight gain, hepatotoxicity, and metabolic abnormalities. The development of diabetes or tardive dyskinesia appears less prevalent than in adults, although this may be a func- tion of short follow-up periods because these side effects may not emerge until adulthood. The management of adverse effects should be proactive with base- line assessment and ongoing monitoring (Table 33.7). Abnormal movements (dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia) need periodic assessment using a standardized instrument such as the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). The need for antiparkinsonian agents may be a consideration, particularly for patients at risk for acute dystonia or who have a previous history of dystonic reactions.

In patients with a per- sonal or family history of cardiac abnormalities, including syncope, palpitations, arrhythmias, or sudden unexplained death, a baseline ECG with subsequent monitoring should be considered, along with cardiology consultation before prescribing. Alternative pharma- cology should be considered if the resting heart rate exceeds 130 beats/min, or the PR, QRS, and QTc exceed 200, 120, and 460 msec, The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes metabolize the antipsychot- ics and as such necessitate that the PCP and psychiatrist are alert for potential drug-drug interactions that may impact the serum levels of all patient medications. CYP3A4 is mainly relevant to lurasidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, and haloperidol, whereas CYP2D6 predomi- nately clears aripiprazole and risperidone. Asenapine is metabolized by CYP1A2 as well as direct glucuronidation by UGT1A4. Because < 10% of paliperidone undergoes CYP first-pass metabolism, there is a lower likelihood of drug-drug interactions. Primary prevention strategies to manage weight and metabolic dys- function include educating the youth and family about healthy lifestyle behaviors and selecting an agent that has the lowest likelihood of impacting metabolic status. Secondary strategies would include intensifying healthy lifestyle instructions, consideration of switch- ing agents, and a weight loss treatment program. Consideration

Tertiary strategies, where diabetes, hypertension, obe- sity, or another metabolic abnormality has occurred, require more intensive weight reduction interventions, changing medication, and consultation with a medical subspecialist. Metformin has been found to be an effective treatment for antipsychotic-induced weight gain in children with autism spectrum disorder. Extrapyramidal adverse effects are generally dose- and titration rate-dependent and may respond to dose or titration rate reductions. More disabling effects may benefit from adjunctive treatment (e.g., anticholinergics, Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare, potentially fatal reaction that can occur during antipsychotic therapy (see Chapter 94). The syndrome generally manifests with fever, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability, and delirium. It is associated with elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels, a metabolic acidosis, and high end-tidal CO, excretion. It has been estimated to occur in 0.2-1% of patients treated with dopamine-blocking agents.

Mortality rates may be as high as 20-30% as a result of dehydration, aspiration, kidney fail- ure, and respiratory collapse. Differential diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome includes infections, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, lethal catatonia, agitated delirium, thyrotoxico- sis, serotonin syndrome, drug withdrawal, and anticholinergic or amphetamine, ecstasy, and salicylate toxicity. MOOD STABILIZERS Because of their limited evidence of effectiveness and concerns about safety, mood-stabilizing medications (see Table 33.5) have limited use in the treatment of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders. For the treatment of bipolar mania in adolescents, antipsychotics are consid- ered first-line therapy. Of the mood stabilizers, lithium alone has rigorous support for the treatment of bipolar mania. Lithium's mechanism of action is not well understood; proposed theories relate to neurotransmission, endocrine effects, circadian rhythm, and cellular processes. Com- mon side effects include polyuria and polydipsia, hypothyroidism,

Periodic monitoring of lithium levels along with thyroid and renal function is needed. Lithium serum levels of 0.8-1.2 mEq/L are targeted for acute episodes, and levels of 0.6-0.9 mEq/L are targeted for maintenance therapy. Acute overdose (level >1.5 mEq/L) manifests with neurologic symptoms (e.g., tremor, ataxia, nystagmus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, slurred speech, delirium, coma, seizures) and altered renal function. Toxicity is enhanced when dehydrated or with drugs that affect renal function, such as NSAIDs or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibi- tors. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been reported in patients concurrently taking antipsychotic drugs and lithium. MEDICATION USE IN PHYSICAL ILLNESS There are special considerations in the use of psychotropic medications with physically ill children. Between 80% and 95% of most psychotropic medications are protein bound; the exceptions are lithium (0%), methyl- phenidate (10-30%), and venlafaxine (25-30%). As a result, psychotro- pic levels may be directly affected because albumin binding is reduced in many physical illnesses. Metabolism is primarily through the liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with excretion via the kidney. Therefore dosages may need to be adjusted in children with hepatic or renal impairment. Hepatic Disease In general, it is necessary to use lower doses of medications for patients with hepatic disease. Initial dosing of medications should 

230 Part Ill • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders be reduced, and titration should proceed slowly. In acute hepatitis, there is generally no need to modify dosing because metabolism is only minimally altered. In chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, hepato- cytes are destroyed, and doses may need to be modified. In steady-state situations, changes in protein binding can result in elevated unbound medication, resulting in increased drug action even in the presence of normal serum drug concentrations. Albu- min and a glycoproteins produced in the liver may be reduced with infectious and inflammatory hepatic disease, whereas surgery, trauma, and cirrhosis may result in elevated protein levels. Because it is often difficult to predict changes in protein binding, it is important to maintain attention to the clinical effects of psy- chotropic medications and not rely exclusively on serum drug concentrations. Medications with high baseline rates of liver clearance (e.g., haloper- idol, sertraline, venlafaxine) are significantly affected by hepatic dis- ease. For drugs that have significant hepatic metabolism, intravenous (IV) administration may be preferred because parenteral administra- tion avoids first-pass liver metabolic effects, and the dosing and action of parenteral medications are similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function. Gastrointestinal Disease GI disease primary affects drug absorption. Examples that impact absorption include conditions affecting GI motility, surgical alterations of the GI tract, short bowel syndrome, or celiac disease. Any condition that diverts blood away from the GI tract (e.g., congestive heart failure, shock) may also reduce absorption. Psychotropic medications have the potential to cause GI side effects. Medications with anticholinergic side effects can slow GI motility, affecting absorption and causing constipation. SSRIs increase gastric motility and can cause diarrhea. SSRIs can increase the risk of GI bleed- ing, especially when administered with NSAIDs. Extended-release or controlled-release preparations of medications can reduce GI side effects, particularly where gastric distress is related to rapid increases in plasma drug concentrations. Using extended-release medication preparations may reduce these side eftects. Renal Disease In general, initial dosages of medication should be reduced or dos- ing intervals lengthened in renal failure. The rule of two thirds is that dosages should be reduced by one third of the normal dosage for a patient with renal insufficiency. However, most psychotropic medications, with the exceptions of lithium and gabapentin, do not require significant dosing adjustments in kidney failure. It is important to monitor serum concentrations in renal insufficiency, particularly for medications with a narrow therapeutic index. Cyclosporine can elevate serum lithium levels by decreasing lithium excretion. Although TCAs have been largely supplanted by SSRIs, patients with kidney failure and those on dialysis appear to be more sensitive to their side effects, possibly because of the accumulation of hydroxylated tricyclic metabolites. Because most psychotropic medications are highly protein bound. they are not significantly cleared by dialysis. Lithium is essentially completely removed by dialysis, and the common practice is to admin- ister lithium after dialysis. Patients on dialysis often have significant fluid shifts and are at risk for dehydration, with neuroleptic malignant syndrome more likely in these situations. Cardiac Disease Antipsychotics, TCAs, and citalopram (>40 mg/day) can lead to prolongation of the QTc interval, with increased risk of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, particularly in patients with structural heart disease. Patients with a baseline QTc interval of >440 msec should be particularly considered at risk. The normal QTc value in children is 400 msec (+25-30 msec). A QTc value that exceeds 2 standard deviations (SDs; >450-460 msec) is considered too long and may be associated with increased mortality. An increase in the QTc from a baseline of >60 msec is also associated with increased mortality. There is increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with preexisting cardiac conduction problems. Patients with Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome who have a short PR interval (<0.12 sec) and widened QRS interval associated with paroxysmal tachy- cardia are at high risk for life-threatening ventricular tachycardia that may be exacerbated by the use of antipsychotics, TCAs, and citalopram. Respiratory Disease Anxiolytic agents can increase the risk of respiratory suppression in patients with pulmonary disease. SSRIs are the first-line medications to consider in treating disabling anxiety. Possible airway compromise caused by acute laryngospasm should be considered when dopamine- blocking antipsychotic agents are used. Neurologic Disease Psychotropic medications can be used safely with epilepsy following consideration of potential interactions among the medication, the seizure disorder, and the anticonvulsant. Any behavioral toxicity of anticonvulsants used either alone or in combination should be consid- ered before proceeding with psychotropic treatment. Simplification of combination anticonvulsant therapy or a change to another agent can result in a reduction of behavioral or emotional symptoms and obviate the need for psychotropic intervention. Clomipramine and bupropion possess significant seizure-inducing properties and should be avoided when the risk of seizures is present. Principles for Psychotropic Prescribing in Primary In the context of a severe and prolonged shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists (CAPs), PCPs are increasingly managing behavioral health conditions in primary care. The principles for effective use of psychotropic medications outlined in the begin- ning of this chapter can be used by PCPs to guide their medica- tion assessment and management (see Table 33.1). This approach emphasizes baseline assessment with standardized symptom rat- ing scales to identify target symptoms and their level of severity, prioritizing FDA-approved medications for the target symptom and patient age range, adherence to recommendations regard- ing therapeutic dosage ranges, using a follow-up symptom rating scale assessment to monitor medication response, continuing the medication trial for sufficient duration, and switching to an alter- native FDA-approved medication if the first medication trial is PCPs can access support for psychotropic prescribing through the development of collaborative relationships with CAPs who can pro- vide timely consultation for questions/advice; interim management until stable; and ongoing care for patients with severe, complex, unsafe, or treatment-refractory conditions. Ideally, consultation with a CAP should occur if one is considering using psychotropic medications with very young children, multiple psychotropic medi- cations, medication doses outside of therapeutic range, or non- FDA-approved medications.

Chapter 34 Psychotherapy Erica H. Lee, Keneisha R. Sinclair-McBride, David R. DeMaso, and Heather J. Walter PSYCHOTHERAPY Psychotherapy is the first-line treatment for many child and adoles- cent psychiatric disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depression, anxiety, behavior, substance-related) because for these disorders, psychotherapy produces outcomes greater than or equal to pharmacotherapy, with less risk of harm. Even with disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention-dehcit/hyperactivity disor- der [ADHD]) for which medication is typically the hrst-line treatment, adjunctive psychotherapy can convey additional benefit. Psychotherapy is moderately effective in reducing psychiatric symp- tomatology and achieving remission of illness. In a 2017 multilevel meta-analysis of almost 500 randomized trials over 5 decades, there was a 63% probability that a youth receiving psychotherapy fared bet- ter than a youth in a control condition. Effects varied across multiple moderators. The mean posttreatment and follow-up effect sizes were highest for anxiety, followed by behavior/conduct, ADHD, and depres- sion, and lowest for multiple concurrent comorbidities. Effect sizes var- ied according to outcome measure informant, with youth and parents generally reporting larger effects than teachers. A variety of psychotherapeutic modalities have been developed, with varying levels of effectiveness (Table 34.1). Differences between thera- peutic approaches may be less pronounced in practice than in theory. The quality of the therapist-patient alliance is consistently one of the chuy on on the most important predictors of treatment outcome. A positive working relationship, expecting change to occur, facing problems assertively, increasing mastery, and attributing change to the participation in the therapy have all been associated with effective therapy, irrespective of the specific psychotherapeutic modality. All psychotherapy interventions involve a series of interconnected steps, including performing an assessment, constructing working diagno- ses and an explanatory formulation, deciding on treatment and a moni- toring plan, obtaining treatment assent/consent, implementing treatment, terminating treatment, and following for symptom recurrence. Psycho- therapists ideally develop a treatment plan by combining evidence-based therapies with clinical judgment and patient/family preference to collab- oratively arrive at a specific intervention plan for the individual patient. Behavior Therapy Behavior therapy is based on both classic (Pavlovian) and operant (Skinnerian) conditioning. Both approaches address the antecedent stimuli and consequent outcomes of problematic thoughts or behav- iors. The treatment begins with a behavioral assessment along with a functional analysis of the setting, immediately preceding events, and real-world outcomes of the behavior to identify the settings in which the behavior occurs and/or the reason the child engages in the behavior. Often the function of problematic behavior is to gain access to atten- tion or a tangible item the child wants or to avoid a task or stressful situation. The goal is to teach the child a more adaptive response using tools such as positive and negative reinforcement; social and tangible rewards; response cost/consequences; shaping, modeling, and prompt- ing; systematic desensitization; and aversive conditioning. Behavior therapy has shown particular effectiveness with opposi- tional behavior, obsessive-compulsive, autism spectrum disorder, and substance use disorders, and ADHD. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is based on social and cognitive learning theories and extends behavior therapy to address the influence Chapter 34 • Psychotherapy 231 of cognitive processes on behavior. CBT is a short-term, problem- and goal-oriented treatment centered on correcting problematic patterns in thinking and behavior that lead to emotional difficulties and functional impairments. The CBT therapist seeks to help the patient identity and change cognitive distortions (e.g., learned helplessness, irrational fears); identify and incrementally approach aversive situations; and identify and practice distress-reducing behavior. Self-monitoring (daily thought records), self-instruction (brief sentences asserting thoughts that are comforting and adaptive), and self-reinforcement (rewarding oneself for adaptive behaviors) are key tools used to facili- tate achievement of the CBT goals. CBT has good-quality evidence for the treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), behavior disorders, substance abuse, and insomnia, and fair evidence for the treatment of depres- sion. For many childhood psychiatric disorders, CBT alone provides outcomes comparable to psychotropic medication alone, and the com- bination of both may convey additional benefit in symptom and harm reduction. Modified versions of CBT have shown applicability to the treatment of other disorders. Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is designed to process and master the psychologic, behavioral, and physiologic con- sequences of a specific traumatic experience. It involves a combina- tion of education about the broad effects of trauma exposure; teaching effective relaxation, affective modulation, and cognitive coping and processing skills; creating a trauma narrative to foster understanding; mastering trauma reminders; enhancing future safety and develop- ment; and teaching parents how to support youth with trauma expo- sure. TF-CBT is considered the first-line treatment for PTSD. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) is a modality targeted at emo- tional and behavioral dysregulation by synthesizing or integrating the seemingly opposite strategies of acceptance and change. Dialectic con- flicts (wanting to die vs wanting to live) often exist in the same patient. The four skills modules-mindfulness (the practice of being fully aware and present in the moment), distress tolerance (how to tol- erate emotional pain), interpersonal effectiveness (how to maintain self-respect and effective communication in relationships with oth- ers), and emotion regulation (how to manage complex emotions)— are balanced in terms of acceptance and change. The treatment targets, in order of priority within a given session, are life-threatening behaviors, such as suicidal and self-injurious behaviors or communica- tions; therapy-interfering behaviors, such as coming late to sessions, canceling appointments, and being uncollaborative in working toward treatment goals; quality-of-life behaviors, including relationship and occupational problems and financial crises; and skills acquisition to help patients achieve their goals. DBT has good-quality evidence for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors and has shown promise for the treatment of bipolar disorder and other manifestations of emotional- behavioral dysregulation. Interpersonal Psychotherapy Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) focuses on resolving interpersonal difficulties that lead to psychologic distress and maladaptive behaviors. Patients are viewed as having strengths and vulnerabilities that deter- mine the manner in which they cope with or respond to an interper- sonal crisis (stressor). The main goals of IPT include expanding social support, decreasing interpersonal stress, enhancing the processing of emotions, and improving social functioning within significant rela- tionships. The interpersonal inventory, a detailed review of the patient's significant relationships, both current and past, with their emotional valence, leads to a formulation linking the interpersonal situations to the emotional/behavior symptoms. Various techniques (linking emo- tions/behaviors to interpersonal events, communication and problem- solving training, perspective-taking, role adaptation) are utilized to resolve interpersonal difficulties. IPT is a well-established treatment for adolescent depression.

Psychodynamic Psychotherapy At the core of psychodynamic psychotherapy lies a dynamic interac- tion between different dimensions of the mind, conscious and uncon- scious. This approach is based on the belief that much of ones mental activity occurs outside one's awareness. The patient is often unaware of internal conflicts because threatening or painful emotions, impulses, and memories are repressed to avoid experiencing psychologic pain. Behavior is then controlled by what the patient does not know about himself or herself. Therapy objectives are to increase self-understanding and acceptance of painful conflicting feelings, and to develop realistic relationships between self and others. A fundamental difference of this modality is its nondirective approach to allow a patient's characteris- tic patterns of thinking and behavior to emerge over time. The rela- tionship between the patient and the therapist can play a key role in identifying these patterns, as they are recapitulated in the therapeutic environment. The therapist can then analyze and interpret the manifest pattern so that self-understanding and a corrective emotional experi- ence can be fostered. Psychodynamic psychotherapy has shown applicability for the treatment of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors as well as anxiety, 

depression, and maladaptive aspects of personality. Brief, time-limited psychodynamic psychotherapy can be appropriate for youth who are in acute situational distress. Long-term therapy can be appropriate when the biologic or social factors destabilizing the child's adaptation and development are chronic, or the psychologic difficulties are complex, or if entrenched conflicts and developmental interferences are present. Supportive Psychotherapy Supportive psychotherapy aims to minimize levels of emotional distress through the provision of individual and contextual support. The goal is to reduce symptoms, and treatment is focused on the "here and now." The therapist is active and helpful in providing the patient with symp- tomatic relief by helping the patient to contain and manage anxiety, sadness, and anger. The therapist provides support and encouragement ("coaching") to bolster a patient's existing coping mechanisms, facili- tates problem solving, and provides social and instrumental support for ameliorating or lessening contextual precipitants. CBT-informed techniques are often combined with supportive psychotherapy. Proba- bly the most common psychotherapy employed by therapists, support- ive psychotherapy has shown comparable results to CBT in a number of research studies, particularly those targeting depression. Family Therapy The core premise in family therapy is that dysfunctional family inter- action patterns precipitate and/or perpetuate an individual's emotional or behavioral difficulties. Family dysfunction can take a variety of forms, including enmeshment, disengagement, role-reversal or confu- sion, and maladaptive communication patterns. Family therapy begins with an assessment of the family system, including observing patterns of interaction; assessing family beliefs and the meanings attached to behaviors; defining social and cultural contexts; exploring the pre- senting problem in the context of individual and family development; assessing the familys style of dealing with problems; and identifying family strengths and weaknesses. Family therapy techniques are drawn from two major theoretical models: structural and behavioral. Structural family therapy develops structures believed to foster well-functioning families, including clear and flexible boundaries between individuals, well-defined roles, and an appropriate balance between closeness and independence. Behavioral family therapy focuses on behavioral sequences that occur in daily life and attempts to interrupt unhelpful behavioral patterns and strengthen positive behavioral patterns through effective communication and problem solving. Family therapy has shown established applicability in anorexia ner- vosa, behavior problems, and substance use and may be a promising treatment for depression and bipolar disorder. Parenting Interventions See Chapters 20 and 42 for more details. Parenting interventions seek to improve both the parent-child rela- tionship and parenting skills using the principles of behavior therapy previously described. These interventions can be provided in individual or group therapy formats. Core relationship recommendations include spending quality time with the child to foster a strong parent-child bond, increasing positive verbal interaction, showing physical affec- tion, and engaging in child-directed play. Core parenting skills include increasing reinforcement of positive behaviors; decreasing reinforce- ment of negative behaviors; ignoring merely annoying behaviors; applying logical consequences for dangerous/destructive behaviors; and making parental responses predictable, contingent, and immedi- ate. Parenting interventions have shown applicability for behavior dis- orders and ADHD. Common Elements of Evidence-Based Psychotherapies A major challenge for the practitioner is selecting the "right interven- tion" for the "right person" in the "right setting," and delivering the intervention in the "right way" (to meet the needs of patients and families). This challenge has led to an interest in identifying common Chapter 34 • Psychotherapy 233 practice elements across efficacious evidence-based therapies that could be "matched" in a flexible way to patients of a certain age, gender, and race/ethnicity who have certain psychiatric disorders. Table 34.2 provides the major practice elements for three of the most common child and adolescent psychiatric disorders: anxiety, depression, and disruptive behaviors. These practice elements, when made available to patients with psychiatric disorders in a system of care, are estimated to be relevant to approximately two thirds of the patients. Six of the practice elements-psychoeducation of the parent, problem-solving skills, relaxation skills, self-monitoring, cognitive/coping skills, and psychoeducation of the child- are applicable to all three disorders and as such could be considered "core competencies" for both mental health specialists as well as primary care practitioners (PCPs) inter- ested in delivering brief psychotherapeutic interventions in the con- text of anticipatory guidance (see Discussion of Common Factors in Psychoeducation is the education of the parent and child about the cause, course, prognosis, and treatment of the disorder. Problem solv- ing includes techniques, discussions, or activities designed to bring about solutions to targeted problems, with the intention of imparting skills for how to approach and solve future problems in a similar man- ner. Relaxation includes techniques designed to create and maintain the physiologic relaxation response. Self-monitoring is the repeated measurement of a target emotional or behavioral metric by the child or parent to establish goals for treatment and monitor progress toward mastery. Cognitive/coping skills consist of techniques designed to alter interpretations of events through examination of the child's reported thoughts, accompanied by exercises designed to test the validity of the reported thoughts. Modular Therapy Packages Of considerable importance to day-to-day clinical work is the manner in which common therapy practice elements are selected, sequenced, repeated, or selectively applied. This coordination of psychothera- peutic elements is particularly relevant for patients presenting with multiple concurrent psychiatric disorders whose primary concern may shift between sessions. The Modular Approach to Therapy for Children (MATCH) is a multi-disorder intervention system that incorporates treatment procedures (practice elements) and treatment logic (coor- dination) corresponding to efficacious interventions for childhood anxiety, depression, traumatic stress, and behavior problems, with modifications to allow the system to operate as a single protocol. Com- pared with standard manualized treatments for individual disorders and with usual care, the modular package outperformed both compar- ators on multiple clinical and service outcome measures when assessed over a 2-year period, although additional, independently derived evi- dence is needed to determine the conditions under which it is most effective and categorize this treatment approach as well established. Treatment Engagement Interventions Treatment engagement is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct targeting cognitive, attendance, and adherence domains. Research has identified several key factors addressing these domains that are associated with treatment engagement: accessibility promo- tion, psychoeducation about services, appointment reminders, assess- ment of treatment barriers, patient assessment, setting of positive expectations, modeling, homework assignments, rapport building, cultural acknowledgement, and goal setting (Table 34.3). To promote treatment engagement, the first 10 of these factors can be addressed by the PCP and the medical home team as soon as a mental health prob- lem is identified that would benefit from treatment (see Chapter 18 for further discussion). Psychotherapy in the Medical Home Recognizing that up to one half of visits to PCPs involve a mental health problem and that an estimated one fifth of pediatric patients have a functionally impairing psychiatric disorder, in the context of limited access to specialty mental health services in community or hospital settings a number of models have been developed to deliver

Two prominent models, both origi- nally developed for adult populations, are collaborative care and pri- mary care behavioral health. Collaborative care, which spans a spectrum ranging from coor- dinated to co-located to integrated, provides mental healthcare for patients through a collaboration between mental health specialists and PCPs. In integrated collaborative care, patients' mental health problems are managed in the medical home setting by an inter- disciplinary care team of PCPs, mental health clinicians, and care coordinators supported by a consulting psychiatrist. The PCP is the "team captain"; the mental health clinician maintains a popu- lation registry, provides brief, focused psychosocial interventions, and monitors treatment response; the care coordinator facilitates external referrals; and the consulting psychiatrist provides input regarding evidence-based psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. The four critical elements of integrated collaborative care are that it is team-driven, population-focused, measurement-guided, and evidence-based. These elements guide a treatment approach in which the patient perceives a seamless integration of medical and mental healthcare. In children and adolescents, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that integrated collaborative care for child behavior prob- lems, adolescent depression, and adolescent substance use is associ- ated with more favorable treatment adherence, symptom reduction, disorder remission, and consumer satisfaction outcomes than usual care, with or without specialty referral. In a meta-analysis of collabora- tive care RCTs, larger effects were observed for treatment trials target- ing diagnoses and elevated symptoms relative to prevention trials and for mental health diagnoses relative to substance-related diagnosis, as well as for integrated models relative to other types of collaborative mental healthcare. Primary care behavioral health employs a mental health clini- cian (psychologist, social worker, mental health counselor) in the primary care setting to provide focused assessment of patients with mental health, health behavior, and substance use problems, and short-term therapy as well as health/mental health promo- tion and prevention interventions. Mental health clinicians typi- cally collaborate with PCPs to develop treatment plans, monitor patient progres and esibly provide are to ach patient chains the entire primary care population, with emphasis on brief, focused The results of brief interventions, particularly applicable to the fast-paced medical home setting, are encouraging. Interventions lasting only one session, particularly those utilizing CBT techniques, can be effective for mild presentations of multiple child psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and behavior problems in children (vs adolescents). These interventions can greatly expand capacity to

DeMaso Medically unexplained physical symptoms are common in children and adolescents. Although frequently chronic and disabling, these symptoms do not often result in referrals for mental health assess- ment and treatment (see Chapter 212). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) somatic symp- tom and related disorders (SSRDs) are those conditions in which the physical symptoms are unexplained or for which the patient's response to the underlying medical condition is disproportionate and debilitating. The SSRDs include somatic symptom disorder (Table 35.1), con- version disorder (Table 35.2), factitious disorders (Table 35.3), illness anxiety disorder (Table 35.4), and other specified/unspecified somatic symptom disorders (Table 35.5), as well as psychologic factors affect- ing other medical conditions (Table 35.6). With the exception of illness anxiety disorder (with high level of anxiety about health in the absence of significant somatic symptoms) and psychologic factors affecting other medical conditions (with psychologic and/or behavioral factors adversely affect a pediatric condition), SSRDs are classified on the basis of physical symptoms associated with clinically significant distress and impairment, with or without the presence of a diagnosed medical condition. Most patients with SSRDs are seen by primary care practitioners or by pediatric subspecialists, who may make specialty-specific diagnoses such as visceral hyperalgesia, chronic fatigue syndrome, psychogenic syncope, or noncardiac chest pain. Even within psychiatry, SSRDs are variously referred to as functional or psychosomatic disorders or as medically unexplained symptoms. The nosologic heterogeneity across the pediatric subspecialties contributes to the varying diagnostic labels. There is a significant overlap in the symptoms and presentation of patients with somatic symptoms who have received different diag- noses from different specialties. Moreover, SSRDs share similarities Table 35.1 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Somatic Symptom Disorder A.

It is helpful for all healthcare providers to avoid the dichotomy of approaching illness using a medical model in which diseases are con- sidered physically or psychologically based. In contrast, a developmen- tal biopsychosocial continuum of disease better characterizes these illnesses as occurring across a spectrum ranging from a predominantly biologic to a predominantly psychosocial etiology. Indeed, there is a neurobiologic component to the related functional neurologic disor- ders, especially related to pain symptoms (see Chapters 212 and 389). SOMATIZATION The term somatization is defined as a pattern of seeking medical help for physical symptoms that cannot be fully explained by pathophysi- ologic mechanisms but are nevertheless attributed to physical dis- ease by the sufferer. It has been described as the propensity to express Table 35.4 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Illness Anxiety Disorder A. Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. B.

It is thought to occur universally in young children (but occurs in every age group) who have not yet developed the cognitive and a linguistic skill needed to compre- hend and communicate their feelings. Between 10% and 30% of children worldwide experience physical symptoms that are seemingly unexplained by a physical illness, with recurrent somatic complaints generally falling into cardiovascular, gas- trointestinal, pain, and pseudoneurologic symptom clusters (Chapter 212). The prevalence of somatization is roughly equal among school- age males and females with a rise in adolescence, at which point somatic complaints in females are five times greater than those in males. Youth with a history of somatization are more likely to experience emotional/ behavioral difficulties, be absent from school, and perform poorly academically. There are high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders in youth with SSRDs. Youth with conversion disorder, specifically

Psychologic or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical condition in one of the following ways: 1. The factors have influenced the course of the medical condition, as shown by a close temporal association between the psychologic factors and the development or exacerbation of, or delayed recovery from, the medical condition. 2. The factors interfere with the treatment of the medical condition (e.g., poor adherence). 3. The factors constitute additional well-established health risks for the individual. 4. The factors influence the underlying pathophysiology, precipitating or exacerbating symptoms or necessitating medical attention. C.

American Psychiatric Association. nonepileptic seizures, have increased rates of comorbid psychopathol- ogy including internalizing disorders and posttraumatic stress disor- ders. Somatization is common in cultures that accept physical illness but not psychologic symptoms as a reason for disability. RISK FACTORS FOR SOMATIZATION Genetic and biologic factors, stressful life events, personality traits and coping styles, cognitive and learning difficulties, learned complaints, family factors, and sociocultural background are potential risk factors that have been associated with pediatric somatization. Genetic and Biologic Factors Somatization clusters in families with increased rates in first-degree relatives of patients with SSRDs. The concordance rates for somatiza- tion approximate 29% in monozygotic twin studies. Genetic factors have been hypothesized to contribute to the development of person- ality traits that may predispose to somatization when combined with environmental factors. Neuroimaging studies have found neuronal areas (premotor and supplementary motor cortexes, the middle frontal gyrus, the anterior cingulate cortex, the insula, and the posterior cin- gulate cortex to differ between patients with SSRDs. Stressful Life Events Stressful life events, including childhood trauma, physical/sexual abuse, bullying, and exposure to natural disasters have all been associ- ated with somatization. Youth with SSRDs have shown high rates of comorbid anxiety, suicidal histories, family psychiatric histories, bully- ing, learning difficulties, and significant life events. Personality Traits and Coping Styles Somatization has been postulated to occur in patients who are unable to verbalize emotional distress and instead use physical symptoms as a means of expression. Physical symptoms have been called a form of body language for children who have difficulty expressing emotions verbally. Examples include individuals who have difficul ties with disclosing traumatic events and high-achieving children who cannot admit they are under too much pressure. Alexithymia has been used to describe individuals with somatic concerns who do not have a verbal vocabulary to describe their feelings. Somatic complaints have also been linked to somatosensory amplification, which is the tendency to experience normal somatic sensations as "intense, noxious and disturbing." When present, patients are hypervigilant to their own bodily sensations, overreact to these sen- sations, and interpret them as indicating physical illness. Chapter 35 • Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders 237 Cognitive and Learning Difficulties Children with difficulties learning and using academic skills, particu- larly in the context of high parental expectations, are associated with increased rates of somatization. Compared with unaffected siblings, youth with "functional" neurologic disorders have been found to score lower on tests of full-scale IQ, vocabulary level, and mathematics as well as to have more learning difficulties. Between 40% and 60% of patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are reported to have learning and subtle language problems. Learned Complaints In operant conditioning learning, attention and sympathy from others and/or decrease in responsibilities (secondary gain) can reinforce somatic complaints. If somatic symptoms are reinforced (i.e., increased parental attention and/or avoidance of unpleasant school pressures) early in the course of an SSRD the likelihood increases that the somatic complaints will become more ingrained and less amenable to change. Social learning theory suggests that somatic symptoms may be a result of "modeling" or "observational learning" within the family. Family members with similar physical complaints (symptom model) are commonly found in SSRDs. Family Factors In family systems theory, somatization can serve the function of draw- ing attention away from other areas of tension with a family. It has been suggested that children in families with significant conflict may develop somatic complaints as a mechanism to avoid any emotional expression that may exacerbate family conflict. Sociocultural Background SSRDs have been reported to be more common in rural areas and among individuals of lower socioeconomic status. Spells or visions are common aspects of culturally sanctioned religious and healing rituals, and falling down with loss or alteration in consciousness is a feature in a variety of culture-specific syndromes. ASSESSMENT The diagnosis of SSRD must be based on the presence of somatic symptoms that are distressing and/or result in significant impairment of daily life. These somatic symptoms must be accompanied by exces- sive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to these symptoms and/ or associated health concerns. SSRDs are not diagnoses of exclusion; the mere absence of a medical explanation is insufficient to make the diagnosis. The assessment of suspected SSRDs should include an assessment of biologic, psychologic, social, and developmental realms, both separately and in relation to each other. A collaborative healthcare approach between pediatric practitioners and mental health clinicians is indicated to ensure that all realms are considered in the assessment of medically unexplained physical symptoms (Table 35.7) Medical Assessment A comprehensive medical workup to rule out serious physical illness is necessary, but must be carefully balanced with efforts to avoid unnec essary and potentially harmful tests and procedures. Certain medical conditions are notoriously overlooked and should be carefully consid- ered as part of the diagnostic workup for problematic somatic symp- toms (Table 35.8). The presence of a medical condition does not exclude the possibility of somatization playing an important role in the presentation. Somatic symp- toms early in a disease course that can be directly attributed to a specific physical illness (e.g., acute respiratory illness) may evolve into psycho- logically based symptoms, particularly in situations where the patient may experience benefit from adopting the sick role. Symptoms may not fol- low known physiologic principles or anatomic patterns and may respond to suggestion or placebo. Physical findings may occur secondary to the effects of the SSRD, especially when chronic or severe (e.g., decondition- ing, disuse atrophy from prolonged immobilization, nutritional deficiency, gastroparesis and constipation from chronic poor oral intake).

Psychosocial Assessment If somatization is suspected, a mental health consultation should be included early in the diagnostic workup. This can be a difficult step for many families given their belief that there is a medical cause for their child's problem. A common response is for the family to react adversely and think that their child's symptoms are not being taken seriously. It is helpful for the pediatric practitioner to frame the consultation as a routine part of the medical workup as well as an opportunity to assess the level of stress connected with the current physical symptoms. The practitioner can communicate that the mental health consultation will be used to gain a more complete understanding of the origins of their child's distress, what perpetuates it, and which treatments are likely to be most effective. The mental health assessment should include a careful assessment of psychosocial stressors, comorbid depression or anxiety disorders, indi- vidual and family histories of somatization, the presence of a model of illness behavior, and evidence of secondary gain resulting from the symptoms. The assessment should provide the pediatric practitioner (s) with a biopsychosocial explanation of the child's symptoms (diagnosis and formulation), which will inform the development of a comprehen- sive biopsychosocial management plan. Differential Diagnoses The primary differential diagnosis is between an SSRD and a physical illness. Importantly, however, these disorders are not mutually exclu- sive and often coexist. Depressive and anxiety disorders frequently include the presence of physical symptoms, which tend to remit with treatment of the primary depressive or anxiety symptoms, and which appear distinct from physical complaints seen in SSRDs. Distinguish- ing features of other physical complaint disorders are noted in Table 35.9. Chronic pain syndromes may be caused by bromyalgia and small hber autonomic neuropathy and complex regional pain syn- drome (see Chapter 211). MANAGEMENT Effective management of SSRDs begins with the development of a posi- tive working relationship between the patient, family, pediatric practi- tioner, and mental health clinician based on a shared understanding of the diagnosis, formulation, and a management plan that generally incorporates a number of different treatment modalities. The formulation of the problem is the crucial hrst step. Patients and their families routinely present with the belief that their symptoms are caused by a medical illness alone. This view needs to be reframed from this narrow medical model view to a comprehensive biopsycho- social understanding. With the completion of medical and psychoso- cial assessments, a joint meeting of the pediatric practitioners) and

Elsevier; 2023: Table 31.14, p. 530. mental health clinician (as well as any involved pediatric specialists) should be arranged to reach and ensure a consensus on the diagnosis and treatment plan and facilitate adequate and consistent communica- tion among all providers. The next step is an "informing conference or meeting" that includes both the managing pediatric practitioner and the family. It is important in this meeting that this practitioner present the medical and psychosocial findings together to the patient and the family in a supportive and nonjudgmental manner. If patients and their families believe that the practitioner understands and empathizes with the degree of distress the somatic symptoms have produced, then they are more likely to be active participants in treatment. Depending on the comfort and expertise of the pediatric practitioner and the sever- ity of the SSRD, the mental health clinician may or may not elect to attend this meeting. After complete medical investigations yield no unifying results, labeling the symptoms as "psychiatric" may be problematic because it can shift the search for the cause onto family functioning, resulting in children and parents feeling blamed for the symptoms. The goal is to avoid such labeling and instead help the family move toward an under- standing of the mind-body connection and to shift their approach from searching for the cause of the symptoms to increasing child functioning. Providing mind-body examples, such as facial flushing when embar- rassed, hand shaking when frightened, or phantom limb pain, will help the patient and family understand how the brain may produce physical symptoms. Treatment With child and family acceptance of a biopsychosocial understanding, an integrated medical and psychosocial treatment approach focused on the development and implementation a treatment plan to improve the patients functioning, and not a continued search for a cause of the pre- senting symptoms, can be implemented. It is helpful to establish real- istic goals that emphasize improvements in functioning rather than the illusion that the symptoms can be completely removed. Those patients with mild-moderate presentations can be treated effectively in the pri- mary or specialty pediatric care setting with appropriate mental health follow-up, whereas those with severe presentations and high complex- ity are better managed in the psychiatry specialty care setting. Role of the Pediatric Practitioner The pediatric practitioner serves an important role in providing ongoing monitoring and treatment for possible physical illness in addition to the recommended mental health interventions. Frequent, brief, and ongoing pediatric visits can be scheduled as a means of helping avoid unneces- sary medical investigations and procedures. This arrangement permits the patient to receive attention from their pediatric practitioner without having to develop somatic symptoms. Furthermore it may reassure the family that the team is continuing to monitor for symptoms that would require further evaluation and helps ensure that any further medical evaluation is directed by a clinician knowledgeable about the previous symptoms and evaluations. It is generally more helpful for the practitio- ner to attend to a patient's anxiety in relation to their physical symptoms rather than the symptoms themselves. This approach has been shown to reduce overall healthcare utilization and to improve patient satisfaction. Using Rehabilitation Approach A rehabilitative approach acknowledges the reality of the symptoms, emphasizes the necessary involvement of mind and body in the recovery process, and shifts the focus from "cure" to "return to normal function- ing" while allowing youth to "save face" through the promotion of physi- cal recovery as the primary goal. A rehabilitative approach includes the use of intensive physical and occupational therapy that emphasizes the recovery of function. This approach can be combined with a behavioral modification program, with incentives for improvements in functioning, while removing secondary gain for illness behavior. In severely disabled patients, it may be preferable to recommend admission to an inpatient medical-psychiatric treatment program that specializes in SSRDs. Another useful option to consider is that of day treatment or partial hospitalization programs. Multidisciplinary inpa- tient rehabilitation programs have much to offer these patients because they are designed to support both physical and psychologic recovery. Families are generally reassured that multidisciplinary staff can con- tinue to monitor physical symptoms, thus ensuring that any missed diagnoses will be recognized quickly. Youth with a high level of impairment often miss a significant amount of school. Communication with the school is often crucial in coordinating a successful reintegration. In addition to discussions with the school guidance counselor and/or nurse, a letter for the school providing education and recommended approaches for the patient's symptoms can be beneficial. These interventions can be formalized by having the school work with the family to develop either a 504 plan for accommodations needed in regular education settings, or an indi- vidualized educational plan (IEP) if the child needs special education services. Ongoing communication between the school and the pediat- ric practitioner for monitoring of further symptoms is recommended. 

240 Part III • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders Psychotherapy and Psychopharmacology Meta-analyses have shown that psychologic treatments improve symp- tom load, disability, and school attendance in youth suffering from various somatic symptoms including functional abdominal symptoms, fatigue, tension-type headache, and musculoskeletal pain. Cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions modify symptom experi- ence and restore central nervous system abnormalities associated with functional impairment. CBT techniques (e.g., relaxation training, biofeedback, hypnosis) can be used to teach patients the control they can have over certain physiologic processes, such as autonomic system activity. Cognitive restructuring is effective in addressing and altering dysfunctional thoughts regarding symptoms and their implications for functioning. Treatments that encourage active coping strategies and emotional expression and modulation are helpful in reducing symp- toms and improving functioning. Modifying parental response pat- terns that are overprotective and potentially reinforcing (e.g., allowing the child to sleep late or to stay home from school in response to symp- toms) help to decrease disability. Psychopharmacologic treatment may be considered when psychi- atric comorbidities are present, specifically, depressive and anxiety disorders. A combination of pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and psychologic interventions in multicomponent management programs has been shown to be effective.

Samsel, Heather J. Walter, and David R. DeMaso Rumination disorder is the repeated regurgitation of food, in which the regurgitated food may be rechewed, reswallowed, or spit out, for a period of at least 1 month following a period of normal func- tioning. Regurgitation is typically frequent and daily; it does not occur during sleep. It is not caused by an associated gastrointestinal illness or other medical conditions (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux, pyloric stenosis). It does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoid- ant/restrictive food intake disorder. If the symptoms occur in the context of an intellectual or other neurodevelopmental disorder, the symptoms must be sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention. Weight loss and failure to make expected weight are common fea- tures in infants with rumination disorder. Infants may display a char- acteristic position of straining and arching the back with the head held back while making sucking movements with their tongue. In infants and older individuals with intellectual disability, the rumina- tion behavior may appear to have a self-soothing or self-stimulating function. Malnutrition may occur in older children and adults, particularly when the regurgitation is associated with restricted food intake (which may be designed to avoid regurgitation in front of oth- ers). They may attempt to hide the regurgitation behavior or avoid eating among others. EPIDEMIOLOGY Originally thought of as a disorder predominantly seen in infants and those with intellectual disability, rumination disorder has also been recognized in healthy individuals across the life span and can be overlooked in adolescents. In otherwise healthy children, rumi- nation disorder typically appears in the first year of life, generally between ages 3 and 12 months. The disorder can have an episodic course or can occur continuously until treatment is initiated. In infants the disorder frequently remits spontaneously but can be protracted with problematic and even life-threatening malnutri- tion. Additional complications related to the secondary effects of malnutrition include growth delay and negative effects on develop- ment and learning potential. ETIOLOGY AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Risk factors for rumination disorder in infants and young children include a disturbed relationship with primary caregivers, lack of an appropriately stimulating environment, neglect, stressful life situations, learned behavior reinforced by pleasurable sensations, distraction from negative emotions, and inadvertent reinforce- ment (attention) from primary caregivers. Risk factors for rumina- tion disorder in adolescents include similar early childhood factors along with female gender and comorbid anxiety and depression. The differential diagnosis includes congenital gastrointestinal system anomalies, pyloric stenosis, Sandifer syndrome, gastroparesis, hiatal hernia, increased intracranial pressure, diencephalic tumors, adrenal insufficiency, and inborn errors of metabolism. Older children and adults with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa may also engage in regurgitation because of concerns about weight gain. The diagnosis of rumination disorder is appropriate only when the severity of the dis- turbance exceeds that routinely associated with a concurrent physical illness or mental disorder. The first step in treatment begins with a behavioral analysis to deter- mine whether the disorder serves a self-stimulation purpose and/or is socially motivated. The behavior may begin as self-stimulation, but it subsequently becomes reinforced and maintained by the social atten- tion given to the behavior. The central focus of behavioral treatment is to reinforce correct eating behavior while minimizing attention to rumination. Diaphragmatic breathing and postprandial gum chewing, when used as a competing response, have been shown to be helpful. Aversive conditioning techniques (e.g., withdrawal of positive atten- tion, introducing bitter/sour flavors when regurgitating) are consid- ered when a child's health is jeopardized but can be more reasonable and useful in adolescents. Additional techniques shown to be useful in adolescents include reswallowing all regurgitation, use of paradoxical intention, and guided progressive food trials. Successful behavioral treatment requires the childs primary caregivers to be involved in the intervention. The caretakers need education and counseling on responding adaptively to the child's behavior as well as altering any maladaptive responses. No current evidence supports a psychopharmacologic intervention for rumina- tion disorder. In more severe or intractable cases (e.g., severe dehy- dration, malnutrition), an intensive integrated medical-behavioral treatment program on a medical or medical-psychiatric unit may Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. 

36.2 Pica Chase B. Samsel, Heather J. Walter, and David R. DeMaso Pica involves the persistent eating of nonnutritive, nonfood sub- stances (e.g., paper, soap, plaster, charcoal, clay, wool, ashes, paint, earth) over a period of at least 1 month. The eating behavior is inap- propriate to the developmental level (e.g., the normal mouthing and tasting of objects in infants and toddlers), and therefore a minimum age of 2 years is suggested. The eating behavior is not part of a cul- turally supported or socially normative practice. A diagnosis of pica may be assigned in the presence of any other feeding and eating disorder. EPIDEMIOLOGY Pica can occur throughout life but occurs most frequently in child- hood. It is more common in those with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders, and to a lesser degree in obsessive- compulsive and schizophrenic disorders. The prevalence of pica is unclear, although it appears to increase with the severity of an intel- lectual disability. It usually remits in childhood but can continue into adolescence and adulthood. Geophagia (eating earth) is asso- ciated with pregnancy and is not seen as abnormal in some cultures (e.g., rural or preindustrial societies in parts of Africa and India). Children with pica are at increased risk for lead poisoning, iron- deficiency anemia, mechanical bowel problems, intestinal obstruc- tion, intestinal perforations, dental injury, and parasitic infections. Pica can be fatal based on substances ingested. ETIOLOGY AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Numerous etiologies have been proposed but not proved, ranging trom psychosocial causes to physical ones. They include nutritional deficiencies (e.g., iron, zinc, calcium), low socioeconomic factors (e.g., lead paint exposure), child abuse and neglect, family disorga- nization (e.g., poor supervision), mental disorder, learned behavior, underlying (but undetermined) biochemical disorder, and cultural and familial factors. The differential diagnosis includes anorexia nervosa, factitious disorder, and nonsuicidal self-injury. A sepa- rate diagnosis of pica should be made only if the eating behavior is sufficiently severe enough to warrant additional clinical attention. TREATMENT Combined behavioral, social, and medical approaches are gener- ally indicated for pica. Assessment for neglect and family supervi- sion combined with psychiatric assessment for concurrent mental disorders and developmental delay are important in developing an effective intervention strategy for pica. Behavioral interventions, particularly applied behavioral analysis in patients with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorders, are increasingly found to be helpful. The sequelae related to an ingested item can require spe- cific treatment (e.g., lead toxicity, iron-deficiency anemia, parasitic infestation).

DeMaso Motor disorders are interrelated sets of psychiatric symptoms charac- terized by abnormal motor movements and associated phenomena. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), they include tic, stereotypic movement, and developmental coordination disorders. Tic disorders (Tourette, persistent motor or vocal tic, provisional tic, other specified/unspecified tic) and stereo- typic movement disorders (SMDs) are addressed in this chapter. Hab- its present as repetitive and often problematic motor behaviors (e.g., thumb sucking, nail biting, teeth grinding). When the problems cause significant distress or impairment they are discussed as body-focused repetitive behavior disorder in the Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders section of DSM-5. 37.1 Tic Disorders Jung Won Kim, Heather J. Walter, and David R. DeMaso Tourette disorder (TD), persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic dis- order (PTD), and provisional tic disorders are characterized by invol- untary, rapid, repetitive, and single or multiple motor and/or vocal/ phonic tics that wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for >1 year since the first tic onset (<1 year for provisional tic disorder) (Table 37.1). PTD is differentiated from TD in that PTD is limited to either motor or vocal tics (not both), whereas TD has both motor and vocal tics at some point in the illness (although not necessarily concur- rently). The tic disorders are hierarchical in order (i.e., TD followed by PTD followed by provisional tic disorder), such that once a tic disorder at one level of the hierarchy is diagnosed, a lower-hierarchy diagnosis cannot be made. Other specified/unspecified tic disorders are pre- sentations in which symptoms characteristic of a tic disorder that cause significant distress or impairment predominate but do not meet the full criteria for a tic or other neurodevelopmental disorder. DESCRIPTION Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations. Simple motor tics (e.g., eye blinking, neck jerking, shoul- der shrugging, extension of the extremities) are fast, brief movements involving one or a few muscle groups. Complex motor tics involve sequentially and/or simultaneously produced, relatively coordinated movements that can seem purposeful (e.g., brushing back ones hair bangs, tapping the foot, imitating someone else's movement [echo- praxial, or making a sexual or obscene gesture [copropraxia]). Simple vocal tics (e.g., throat clearing, sniffing, coughing) are solitary, mean- ingless sounds and noises. Complex vocal tics involve recognizable word or utterances (e.g., partial words [syllables], words out of context, obscenities or slurs (coprolalia], repeating one's own sounds or words (palilalia], or repeating the last heard word or phrase [echolalia]).

Sensory phenomena (premonitory urges) that precede and trigger the urge to tic have been described. Individuals with tics can suppress them for varying periods of time, particularly when external demands exert their influence, when deeply engaged in a focused task or activity, or during sleep. Tics are often suggestible and are worsened by anxi- ety, excitement, or exhaustion. Parents have described increasing fre- quency of tics at the end of the day. CLINICAL COURSE Onset of tics is typically between ages 4 and 6 years. The frequency of tics tends to wax and wane with peak tic severity between ages 10 and 12 years and marked attenuation of tic severity in most individuals (65%) by age 18-20 years. A small percentage will have worsening tics into adulthood. New onset of tics in adulthood is very rare and most often is associated with exposure to drugs or insults to the central ner- vous system. Tics manifest similarly in all age groups, with changes in affected muscle groups and vocalizations that occur over time. Some individuals may have tic-free periods of weeks to months. EPIDEMIOLOGY 2:1 to 4:1. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The differential diagnosis includes other repetitive movements of childhood (Table 37.2). Tics may be difficult to differentiate from ste- reotypies. Although stereotypies may resemble tics, stereotypies are typically rhythmic movements and do not demonstrate the change in body location or movement type over time that is typical of tics. Compulsions may be difficult to differentiate from tics when tics have premonitory urges. Tics should be differentiated from a variety of developmental and benign movement disorders (e.g., benign parox- ysmal torticollis, Sandifer syndrome, benign jitteriness of newborns, shuddering attacks). Although tics may present in various neurologic illnesses (e.g., Wilson disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Huntington syn- drome, various frontal-subcortical brain lesions), it is rare for tics to be the only manifestation of these disorders (Table 37.3). Individuals presenting with tics in the context of declining motor or cognitive function should be referred for neurologic assessment. Substances/medications that are reported to worsen tics include selec- tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), lamotrigine, and cocaine. If tics develop in close temporal relationship to the use of a substance or medication and then remit when use of the substance is discontinued, a causal relationship is possible. Stimulants do not commonly increase COMORBIDITIES Comorbid psychiatric disorders are common, often with both patient and family viewing the accompanying condition as more problem- atic than the tics. There is a bidirectional association between PTD/ TD (especially TD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with 20-60% of TD patients meeting OCD criteria and 20-40% of OCD patients reporting tics (Fig. 37.1). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis- order (ADHD) occurs in approximately 50% of all childhood PTD/ TD, but estimates in clinically referred patients suggest much higher rates (60-80%). PTD/TD is often accompanied by behavior problems, including poor frustration tolerance, temper outbursts, and oppo- sitionality. Learning disabilities have been found in >20% of these patients. Concurrent anxiety and depression have also been observed. Some patients with PTD/TD will display symptoms of autism spec- trum disorder (ASD); careful assessment is required to determine which disorder is primary. ETIOLOGY Tics are proposed to be the result of dysfunctional corticostriatal- thalamocortical motor pathways in the basal ganglia, striatum, and frontal lobes associated with abnormalities in the dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine neurotransmitter systems. Male predominance in PTD/TD may be attributable to influences of sex hormones on the neu- rodevelopment of these motor pathways, as reflected by the effects of antiandrogens in the treatment of TD. Family studies suggest a 10-100-fold increased risk of PTD/TD among first-degree relatives compared to rates in the general popula- tion. Twin studies also support a genetic link, with approximately 80% of monozygotic twins and 30% of dizygotic twins showing concordance for PTD/TD. Candidate-gene association and nonparametric linkage studies have not identified specific susceptibility genes for PTD/TD. Autoimmune-mediated mechanisms have been hypothesized as having a potential etiologic role in some tic disorders. The pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococ- cal infection (PANDAS) designation describes cases of acute child- hood onset of OCD and/or tics following a streptococcal infection. Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) describes a subtype of acute childhood-onset OCD (tics are not a required fea- ture) in which a link to a prior streptococcal infection is not evident, suggesting that other infectious agents may be responsible. In addition to a diagnosis of OCD and tics, children with PANS/PANDAS may potentially have separation anxiety, nightmares, personality change, oppositional behaviors, and deterioration in math skills and handwrit- ing. Although some studies suggest a prior history of infections may increase the risk for developing tic disorder, this remains controversial. Premorbid stress has been hypothesized to act as a sensitizing agent in the pathogenesis of TD among susceptible individuals by affecting stress-responsive biologic systems such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-

J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2013;52(12): 1341-1359. SEQUELAE Many individuals with mild to moderate tics express minimal to no distress or functional impairment and may even be unaware of their tics. Even individuals with moderate to severe tics can experience minimal functional impairment, but psychologic distress may occur. Infrequently, the presence of tics can lead to social isolation, social victimization, inability to work or attend school, or impaired quality of life. TD/PTD is associated with increased risk of suicide. Suicidal behavior should be monitored, particularly in those with persistent tics, history of suicide attempts, and psychiatric comorbidities. SCREENING Pediatric practitioners should routinely screen for unusual movements (e.g., sudden twitches or jerks, eye blinking, neck twisting, muscle tight- ening, shoulder shrugging, or involuntary gestures) or vocalizations (e.g., utter involuntary sounds, like grunts, yelps, squeaks, or throat clears). Often families are unaware that frequent sniffing, coughing, or blinking may be indicative of tics, attributing these behaviors to medi- cal problems (e.g., allergies, visual problems). A careful assessment of the timing, triggers, and specific characteristics may differentiate tics from other medical problems. If differentiation is difficult, a referral to a pediatric specialist in the affected system is warranted. ASSESSMENT If the screening suggests the presence of a tic disorder, a more com- prehensive evaluation should ensue, including the age of onset, types of tics, tic frequency, alleviating and aggravating factors, and a family history of tics. Parent rating scales specific for tics (e.g., the Motor Tic, Obsessions and Compulsions, Vocal Tic Evaluation Survey [MOVES] and Autism-Tics, ADHD and other Comorbidities inven- tory (A-TAC) can supplement the assessment. For clinician-rated tic severity, the most comprehensive, reliable, and valid instrument is the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGISS), though its relatively long administration makes routine use in clinical practice problematic (https://candapediatricmedicalhomes.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/ yale-global-tic-severity-scale.pdf). A medical workup should be considered for new-onset tics, par- ticularly for presentations characterized by sudden onset, atypi- cality, or mental status abnormalities. Basic laboratory measures (hemogram, renal/hepatic function panel, thyroid panel, and fer- ritin, along with urine drug screen for adolescents) should be con- sidered. For new, sudden onset, or severe symptom exacerbation, pediatric practitioners may assess for concurrent acute infection (e.g., culture, rapid viral tests). Electroencephalography and brain imaging are not routinely recommended for isolated tics and should be reserved for patients with other neurologic findings that might suggest an autoimmune encephalitis syndrome (limbic encepha- litis). Comorbid psychiatric disorders (e.g., OCD, ADHD, ASD) should be investigated. TREATMENT The decision to treat tics is made with the child and family based on the level of impairment and distress caused by the tics. If tics are mild in severity, the pediatric practitioner can provide the family with educa- tion, often with no need for further intervention. Patient and family education should include common symptom presentations, implications of concurrent conditions, course and prog- nosis, and treatment options (including no treatment). The patient's typical exacerbating and alleviating factors should be outlined. Pedi- atric practitioners can also direct the patient and family to infor- mational websites, including the Tourette Association of America (www.tourette.org). Almost 75% of children with TD/PTD receive some form of class- room accommodation (e.g., directions to ignore tics and permission to leave the room as needed). The accommodations may need to be formalized in an individualized education plan (IEP) if a child needs special education services or a 504 plan if the child just needs accom- modations in the regular classroom.

Referral to a behavioral treatment specialist should be considered when tics are distressing or functionally impairing. The behavioral interventions with the strongest empirical support are habit reversal therapy (HKI) and comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT). The basic components of HRT include premonitory urge awareness training and building a competing response to the urge to tic (Table 37.4). Based on HRT, CBIT additionally includes relaxation training and a functional intervention designed to mitigate against tic-generating situations. A course of HRT/CBIT treatment typically takes several months or 8-10 sessions. CBIT has been found to reduce significantly the severity of tics compared to education and supportive therapy. Medications should be considered when the tics are causing severe impairment in the quality of life or when psychiatric comorbidities are present. The only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved medications to treat TD in children and adolescents are Obsessive- compulsive disorder Attention- deficit/ hyperactivity disorder Depression Impulse control disorders Tourette disorder plus Pure Tourette disorder Fig. 37.1 Schematic representation of the behavioral spectrum in Tourette disorder. The size of each area is proportional to the estimated prevalence of the symptoms; the background color intensity is propor- tional to the complexity of the clinical presentation. (From Cavanna AE, Seri S. Tourette's syndrome. BMJ. 2013;347:4964.) two first-generation antipsychotics (haloperidol, pimozide) and one second-generation antipsychotic (aripiprazole). a-Agonists (clonidine, guanfacine) are also considered as first-line agents because of their more favorable side effect profile compared with the antipsychotic medications (see Chapter 33). Youths with tic disorders may benefit from SSRIs for the treat- ment of comorbid obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, or depressive disorders. Augmentation of SSRIs with an atypical antipsychotic has been a consideration in patients with concurrent tic disorders and OCD responding poorly to an SSRI alone. The presence of tics does not preclude the use of stimulants to address comorbid ADHD. Treatment of tics and comorbid ADHD with a combina- tion of a-agonists and stimulants (e.g., clonidine with methylphe- nidate) decreases tics. Close clinical monitoring is required for possible exacerbation of tics during stimulant treatment. Anger and rage outbursts are common particularly among youth with severe tics (up to 80% in clinically referred samples). Behavioral therapies (cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT], parent management training; see Chapter 34) that address anger management may be useful. A systematic review indicated high confidence of efficacy for CBIT; moderate confidence for medications, such as haloperidol, risperidone, aripiprazole, clonidine; and low confidence for medi- cations, such as ziprasidone, guanfacine, and topiramate. No evi- dence exists to differentiate the effectiveness of HRT/CBIT alone vs combined with pharmacotherapy as tic disorder treatment options. There is no rigorous scientific evidence to support the use of deep brain stimulation, repetitive magnetic stimulation, or dietary sup- plements in the treatment of TD or PTD. In severe presentations, pediatric practitioners should consider seeking consultations from and/or making referrals to pediatric tic disorder specialists (i.e., behavioral psychologist, pediatric neurol- ogist, developmental-behavioral pediatrician, or child and adoles- cent psychiatrist) in determining a treatment regimen. 

37.2 Stereotypic Movement Disorder Jung Won Kim, Heather J. Walter, and David R. DeMaso Stereotypic movement disorder (SMD) is defined in DSM-5 as a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor behavior (stereotypy) that interferes with social, academic, or other activities and may result in self-injury. The onset of SMD is the early developmental period (often before age 3 years), and the symptoms are not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance or neurologic condition and are not better explained by another neurodevelopmental or men- tal disorder. The disorder is considered mild if symptoms are easily suppressed by sensory stimulation or distraction, and severe if con- tinuous monitoring and protective measures are required to prevent serious injury, with moderate falling between mild and severe. DESCRIPTION Examples of stereotypic movements include hand shaking or wav- ing, body rocking, head banging, self-biting, and hitting one's own body. The presentation depends on the nature of the stereotypic movement and level of the child's awareness of the behavior. Among typically developing children, the repetitive movements may be stopped when attention is directed to the movements or when the child is distracted from performing them. Among youth with intellectual disability, the behaviors may be less responsive to such efforts. Each individual presents with their own uniquely patterned behavior. Stereotypic movements may occur many times during a day, lasting a few seconds to several minutes or longer. The behav- iors may occur in multiple contexts, including when the individual is excited, stressed, fatigued, or bored. CLINICAL COURSE Stereotypic movements typically begin before age 3 years. In those who develop complex motor stereotypies, the great majority exhibit these symptoms before 24 months. In most typically developing youth, these movements resolve over time. Among those with intellectual disability, the stereotyped behaviors may persist for years, although the pattern may change over time. EPIDEMIOLOGY Simple stereotypic movements are common in typically develop- ing young children. Some children may bang their head on their banging, can occur in up to 25% of typically developing toddlers (often during tantrums), but they are almost invariably associated with developmental delay in youth older than 5 years. Complex ste- reotypic movements are much less common (approximately 3-4%). Between 4% and 16% of patients with intellectual disability engage in stereotypic movements. COMORBIDITY Stereotypic movements are a common manifestation of a variety of neurogenetic disorders, such as Lesch-Nyhan, Rett, fragile X, Cornelia de Lange, and Smith-Magenis syndromes. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS According to DSM-5, stereotypic movements must be differentiated from normal development, ASDs, tic disorders, OCDs, and other neurologic/medical conditions. Simple stereotypic movements occurring in the context of typical development usually resolve with age. Stereotypic movements may be a presenting symptom of ASD, but SMD does not include the deficits in the social communication characteristic of ASD. When ASD is present, SMD is diagnosed only Chapter 37 • Motor Disorders and Habits 245 when there is self-injury or when the stereotypic behaviors are suf- ficiently severe to become a focus of treatment. Typically, SMD has an earlier age of onset than the tic disorders. SMD is distinguished from OCD by the absence of obsessions as well as the nature of the repetitive behaviors, which in OCD are purposeful (e.g., in response to obsessions). The diagnosis of stereotypic movements requires the exclusion of mannerisms, paroxysmal dyskinesias, and benign hereditary chorea. A neurologic history and examination are required to assess features suggestive of other disorders, such as myoclonus, dystonia, and chorea. ETIOLOGY There is a possible evolutionary link between repetitive abnormal grooming-like behaviors and early human experience with adver- sity. Brain regions implicated in this model (e.g., amygdala, hip- pocampus) are those involved in navigating human experience through unpredictable, anxiety-provoked emotional states, as well as regions (e.g., nucleus accumbens) related to pleasure and reward seeking. The latter involves the hypothesis that individuals expe- rience some level of gratification from performing the stereotypic Social isolation with insufficient stimulation (e.g., severe neglect) is a risk factor for self-stimulation that may progress into stereo- typies, particularly repetitive rocking or spinning. Environmental stress may trigger stereotypic behaviors. Repetitive self-injurious behavior may be a behavioral phenotype in neurogenetic syndromes (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan, Rett, and Cornelia de Lange syndromes). Lower cognitive functioning is also linked to greater risk of stereotypic TREATMENT The initial approach to mild stereotypy is for the primary caretak- ers to ignore the undesired behavior, encourage substitute behavior, and not convey worry to their child. These behaviors may disappear with time and elimination of attention in young children. How- ever, in children with intellectual disability or ASDs, stereotypies may be more refractory to treatment than in typically developing children and may necessitate referral to a behavioral psychologist, developmental-behavioral pediatrician, or child and adolescent psy- chiatrist for behavioral and/or psychopharmacologic management. The pediatric practitioner should consider and rule out neglect of the child, which can be associated with repetitive rocking, spinning, or other stereotypic movements. Behavior therapy is the mainstay of treatment, using a variety of strategies, including habit reversal, relaxation training, self-monitoring contingency management, competing responses, and negative practice. The environment should also be modified to reduce risk of injury to those engaging in self-injurious behavior. Atypical antipsychotic medications may be helpful in reducing ste- reotypic movements in youth with ASD. Patients with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behaviors treated with SSRIs may show improve- ment in their stereotypic movements. HABITS Habits involve an action or pattern of behavior that is repeated often. Habits are common in childhood and range from usually benign and transient behaviors (eg., thumb sucking, nail biting) to more problematic (e.g., trichotillomania, bruxism). In DSM-5, habits are not included as a diagnostic category because they are not viewed as disorders causing clinically significant distress or impair- ment in functioning. When they do cause distress or impairment or are associated with repeated attempts by the individual to stop the behavior they are discussed as body-focused repetitive behavior disorder. HRT has been effective as a first-line treatment approach (see Table 37.4). 

246 Part III • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders Table 37.4 Components of Habit Reversal Training INCREASE INDIVIDUAL'S AWARENESS OF HABIT Response description-have individual describe behavior to therapist in detail while reenacting the behavior and looking in a mirror. Response detection-inform individual of each occurrence of the behavior until each occurrence is detected without assistance. Early warning-have individual practice identifying earliest signs of the target behavior. Situation awareness-have individual describe all situations in which the target behavior is likely to occur. TEACH COMPETING RESPONSE TO HABIT The competing response must result in isometric contraction of muscles involved in the habit, be capable of being maintained for 3 min, and be socially inconspicuous and compatible with normal ongoing activities but incompatible with the habit (e.g., clenching one's fist, grasping and clenching an object). For vocal tics and stuttering, deep relaxed breathing with a slight exhale before speech has been used as the competing response. SUSTAIN COMPLIANCE Habit inconvenience review-have individual review in detail all problems associated with target behavior. Social support procedure- -family members and friends provide high levels of praise when a habit-free period is noted Public display-individual demonstrates to others that he or she can control the target behavior in situations in which the behavior occurred in the past. FACILITATE GENERALIZATION-SYMBOLIC REHEARSAL PROCEDURE For each situation identified in situation awareness procedure, individual imagines himself or herself beginning the target behavior but stopping and engaging in the competing response.

Thumb Sucking Thumb sucking is common in infancy and occurring in as many as 25% of children age 2 years and 15% of children age 5 years. Thumb sucking beyond 5 years of age may be associated with sequelae (e.g., paronychia, anterior open bite). As with other rhythmic patterns of behavior, thumb sucking is self-soothing. Basic behavioral manage- ment, including encouraging parents to ignore thumb sucking and instead focus on praising the child for substitute behaviors, is often an effective treatment. Simple reminders and reinforcers can also be considered; giving the child a sticker or other reward for each block of time that they do not thumb suck. In rare cases, mechani- cal devices placed on the thumb or in the mouth to prevent thumb sucking or noxious agents (bitter salves) placed on the thumb may be part of the treatment plan. Bruxism or teeth grinding is common (5-30% of children), can begin in the first 5 years of life, and may be associated with daytime anxiety. Persistent bruxism can manifest as muscular or temporomandibular joint pain. Untreated bruxism can cause problems with dental occlu- sion. Helping the child find ways to reduce anxiety might relieve the problem; bedtime can be made more relaxing by reading or talking with the child and allowing the child to discuss fears. Praise and other emotional support are useful. Persistent bruxism requires referral to a dentist given the risk for dental occlusion.

Kim Anxiety is not necessarily pathologic, is seen across the life span, and can be adaptive (e.g., the anxiety one might feel during life-threatening situations). It has both a cognitive-behavioral component, expressed in worrying and wariness, and a physiologic component, mediated by the autonomic nervous system. Anxiety is characterized as pathologic (e.g., a disorder) when it becomes disabling, interferes with social interac- tions, or derails normal development. Anxiety disorders are some of the most common psychiatric disor- ders in childhood. The point prevalence worldwide is nearly 7%, and the estimated lifetime prevalence in the United States is approximately 20-30%. Anxiety disorders are often comorbid with other psychiatric and medical disorders, and they can have physical manifestations, such as weight loss, palpitations, tremors, muscle cramps, paresthesias, hyper- reflexia, and abdominal distress (Table 38.1). Although onset can be acute, the course is generally chronic with periods of fluctuating severity. The potential consequences of untreated anxiety include impairments in social, educational, and overall functioning. Because anxiety is both a normal phenomenon and, when highly activated, strongly associated with impairment, the clinician is tasked with differentiating between normal anxiety and abnormal anxiety across development (Fig. 38.1). The median age of onset is 11 years. However, there are known peri- ods of typical onset during specific developmental phases for both nor- mal and pathologic anxiety. Normal stranger anxiety begins around 7-9 months of age. Preschoolers typically have specific fears related to the dark, animals, and imaginary situations. Separation anxiety can occur during the preschool years. Although most school-aged children abandon the imaginary fears of early childhood, some replace them with fears of bodily harm or other worries, reaching the level of a spe- cific phobia (Table 38.2). Some characteristics of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can be considered typical in early school-ages, but OCD often has its onset in the mid-school-aged years (Table 38.3). Social anxiety occurs in later grade-school ages and early adolescence (Table 38.4) as the value of peer relationships increases. Generalized anxiety, panic, and agoraphobia tend to occur during the teen and young adult years (Tables 38.5 to 38.7). Genetic or temperamental factors contribute more to the develop- ment of some anxiety disorders, whereas environmental factors are closely linked to the cause of others. Specifically, behavioral inhibition (sensitivity to novel stimuli) appears to be a heritable tendency and is linked with social phobia, generalized anxiety, and selective mutism. OCD and other disorders associated with OCD-like behaviors, such as Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders, tend to have high genetic risk as well (see Chapter 37.1).

Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 mo, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). B. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry. C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 mo): Note: Only one item is required in children. 1. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge. 2. Being easily fatigued. 3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank. 4. Irritability. 5. Muscle tension. 6.

ASSESSMENT There is no recommendation for routine screening of children and adolescents for anxiety disorders. Freely available general screening instruments such as the Pediatric Symptom Checklist and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire can be used to identify anxiety concerns in primary care and school settings. Rating scales can be used to sup- port diagnosis and to follow response to treatment, but they are not diagnostic on their own. Commonly used anxiety rating scales include the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS), the Preschool Anxiety Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pediatric Short Form-Anxiety-8a. Symptoms of anxiety are typically identified through the clinical interview by asking questions about "worries, "fears," and "stress" or by the patient and family's spontaneous report. The interview must be developmentally sensitive, and further discussions with the family may reveal environmental reinforcements, including the caregiver's parent- ing style and enabling of avoidance behaviors. Because some degree of anxiety is considered normal, it is impor- tant to clarify when the symptom severity reaches the point of being pathologic and to differentiate between the subtypes (Table 38.9). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) has specific criteria for each type of anxiety with require- ments for frequency, duration, and extent of functional impairment. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES In addition to determining whether diagnostic criteria are met for a specific anxiety disorder, it is also crucial to rule out alternative explanations. The differential diagnosis includes numerous medical Table 38.6 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Panic Disorder A. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which time four (or more) of the following symptoms occur: Note: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious 1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate. 2. Sweating. 3. Trembling or shaking. 4. Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering. 5. Feelings of choking. 6. Chest pain or discomfort. 7. Nausea or abdominal distress. 8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint. 9. Chills or heart sensations. 10. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations). 11. Derealizations (feeling or unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself). 12. Fear of losing control or "going crazy." 13. Fear of dying. Note: Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms. B. At least one of the attacks has been followed by 1 mo (or more) of one or both of the following: 1. Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, "going crazy"). 2. A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., behaviors designed to avoid having panic attacks, such as avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations) C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, cardiopulmonary disorders). D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., the panic attacks do not occur only in response to feared social situations, as in social anxiety disorder; in response to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific phobia; in response to obsessions, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder; or in response to reminders of traumatic events, as in posttraumatic stress disorder; or in response to separation from attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder). From the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. pp 208-209. Copyright 2013. American Psychiatric Association.. conditions and medication-induced anxiety (Table 38.10). Anxiety dis- orders also frequently occur with not just other anxiety subtypes but also other psychiatric comorbidities, notably depression and substance use disorders (Table 38.11; see Table 38.1). TREATMENT OF ANXIETY Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a therapy that targets the cog- nitions, behaviors, and physiologic symptoms of anxiety, with a par- ticular focus on the interconnections between the three. Its framework typically involves homework assignments for practicing the skills in real-life environments. The goal is to achieve functional improvement within approximately 18 sessions. Because it is a skills-based treatment, CBT is thought to be a durable treatment, an important consideration when treating children and adolescents. It is specifically recommended to patients 6-18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, sepa- ration anxiety, specific phobia, and panic disorder. Specialized training and experience are paramount to the effective delivery of this treatment modality, and it is worth taking the time to ensure that patients identify therapists with the training and experience to provide rigorous CBT. CBT typically should incorporate graduated exposure, in which stepwise mastery of a hierarchy of fearful stimuli results in desensitization. 

250 Part Ill • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders Table 38.7 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Agoraphobia A. Marked fear or anxiety about two (or more) of the following five situations: 1. Using public transportation (e.g., automobiles, buses, trains, ships, planes). 2. Being in open spaces (e.g., parking lots, marketplaces, bridges). 3. Being in enclosed places (e.g., shops, theaters, cinemas). 4. Standing in line or being in a crowd. 5. Being outside of the home alone. B. The individual fears or avoids these situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of a developing panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fear or falling in the elderly, fear of incontinence). C. The agoraphobic situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. D. The agoraphobic situations are actively avoided, require the presence of a companion, or are endured with intense fear or anxiety. E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context. F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 mo or more. G. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important area of functioning. H. If another medical condition (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson disease) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly excessive. I. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms or another mental disorder-for example, the symptoms are not confined to specific phobia or situational type; do not involve only social situations (as in social anxiety disorder); and are not related exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder), reminders or traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder), or fear of separation (as in separation anxiety disorder). Note: Agoraphobia is diagnosed irrespective of the presence of panic disorder. If an individual's presentation meets criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia, both diagnoses should be assigned.

The therapy with the most evidence for PTSD is a subtype of CBT called trauma-focused CBT (TF-CBT). Given that standard anxiety medications are less effective in PTSD, it is particularly crucial that clinicians refer these patients to trauma-focused therapy. In TF-CBT, the therapist amplites stress management techniques in preparation for exposure-based interventions with the goal of achieving mastery over trauma triggers. In small adult trials, ketamine- or 3,4-methyl enedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy have shown benefit. There is insufficient evidence to currently recommend either therapy. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as a class are effective in treating anxiety. The available options include citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and vilazodone. Despite randomized clinical trials (RCTs) providing support for the safety and effectiveness of this medication class, no specific SSRIs are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for anxiety in children. SSRIs are generally well tolerated, with the most common side effects involving xerostomia, gastrointestinal upset, headache, somnolence or insomnia, dizziness, fatigue, and changes in appetite (see Chapter 33). RCTs in children and adolescents with PTSD found no significant dif - ference between SSRI and placebo. SSRIs may be considered in pediatric patients with PTSD who have comorbid conditions responsive to SSRIs, including depression, affective numbing, and anxiety (see Table 33.5). All of the SSRIs carry a "black box" warning for suicidal thinking and behavior through age 24 years, and this specific risk must be discussed with the patient and caregiver and documented before initiation. Other potential adverse effects include behavioral activation, hypomanic or manic symptoms, and serotonin syndrome (see Chapter 33). Combination Treatment The combination of CBT and an SSRI is generally thought to be better than either treatment alone for moderate to severe anxiety. It is impor- tant to continue recommending CBT even after the decision has been made to start pharmacologic treatment. Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and has an FDA indication for the treatment of generalized anxiety dis- order in children ages 7-17. However, it is still considered a second-line treatment as SSRIs tend to be more effective. The other SNRI options are venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine. Potential side effects of dulox- etine include xerostomia, diaphoresis, abdominal discomfort, gastro- intestinal distress, headache, tremor, sedation or insomnia, decreased appetite, and weight loss. Of note, it is less likely to cause behavioral activation than the SSRIs. a-Agonists Clonidine and guanfacine are a-agonists and may be helpful for PTSD by targeting sleep disturbances like nightmares, persistent physiologic arousal, and exaggerated startle response. OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER AND PEDIATRIC ACUTE-ONSET NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYNDROME Obsessive-compulsive symptoms can be effectively treated with SSRIs (sertraline, fluoxetine). If the patient's symptoms prove to be treatment-refractory to the standard options, then one might consider fluvoxamine and/or clomipramine, which is a heterocyclic antidepres- sant. These are indicated when a patient has failed two or more SSRI trials. Habit reversal training is an important nonpharmacologic treat- ment modality for OCD as well. A proportion of abrupt-onset OCD cases are attributed to an immune response that targets the brain (pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS]). The immune response may be brought about by

CRITERION 2 Concurrent presence of additional neuropsychiatric symptoms with similarly severe and acute onset from at least two of the following seven categories: 2. Emotional lability or depression. 3. Irritability, aggression, or severely oppositional behaviors. 4. Behavioral (developmental) regression. 5. Deterioration in school performance. 6. Sensory or motor abnormalities. 7. Somatic signs and symptoms, including sleep disturbances, enuresis, or urinary frequency. CRITERION 3 Symptoms are not better explained by a known neurologic or medical disorder, such as Sydenham chorea, systemic lupus erythematosus, Tourette disorder, autoimmune encephalitis, or others. The diagnostic workup of patients with suspected PANS must be comprehensive enough to rule out these and other relevant disorders. The nature of the co-occurring symptoms will dictate the necessary assessments, which may include MRI scans, lumbar puncture, electroencephalograms, or other diagnostic tests.

There are no DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PANS. One suggested approach to PANS diagnostic criteria is noted in Table 38.12. Of note is the abrupt-sudden onset of OCD, the presence of additional psychi- atric disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, emotional lability), and the requirement to rule out other disorders like Sydenham chorea. If PANS is suspected, a comprehensive evaluation is warranted primarily to rule out neurologic and medical conditions (see Table 38.12). Children with an abrupt onset of psychiatric and neuro- logic findings should be evaluated with MRI, electroencephalo- gram (EEG), and blood plus cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) autoimmune encephalitis antibody testing. Children with a sudden onset of only psychiatric symptoms (OCD, tics, anxiety) do not require exten- sive testing except for testing for a group A streptococcus, unless they have severe and disabling psychiatric features, The latter group should be evaluated to rule out the disorders noted in Table 38.12. Once diagnosed, clinicians should prioritize the target symptoms of the individual patient and select treatments accordingly. The three realms of PANS treatment are psychotherapeutic, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory. Because behavioral interventions take time to work, psychiatric interventions should begin expeditiously for symptomatic relief. Antibiotics may eliminate the underlying source of neuroinflammation, and immunomodulatory options can help treat immune system disturbances.

Chapter 39 Mood Disorders Colleen K. Manak and Rosa K. Kim Mood disorders encompass several different entities on the spectrum between depression and mania. Mood disorders are interrelated sets of psychiatric symptoms characterized by a core defcit in emotional self-regulation. Classically, the mood disorders have been divided into depressive and bipolar disorders, representing the two emotional polarities, dysphoric ("low") and euphoric ("high") mood. Mood disor- ders in children and adolescents are highly prevalent and are the most common psychiatric illnesses seen after attention-dencit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. Primary care is often their first point of contact when seeking treatment. 39.1 Depressive Disorders Colleen K. Manak and Rosa K. Kim Depressive disorders include major depressive, persistent depressive, disruptive mood dysregulation, other specified/unspecified depressive, premenstrual dysphoric, and substance/medication-induced ders, as well as depressive disorder caused by another medical condi- tion (Fig. 39.1). DESCRIPTION Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a distinct period of at least 2 weeks (an episode) in which there is a depressed or irritable mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure in almost all activi- ties that is present for most of the day, nearly every day (Table 39.1 and Fig. 39.2). Major depression is associated with characteristic veg- etative and cognitive symptoms, including disturbances in appetite, sleep, energy, and activity level; impaired concentration; thoughts of worthlessness or guilt; and suicidal thoughts or actions. Major depression is considered mild if few or no symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, and the symptoms are mildly distressing, manageable, and result in minor functional impairment. Major depression is considered severe if symptoms sub- stantially in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are pres- ent, and the symptoms are highly distressing, unmanageable, and markedly impair function. Moderate major depression is intermedi- ate in severity (Fig. 39.3). Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by depressed or irri- table mood for more days than not, for at least 1 year (in children and adolescents). This chronic form of depression is associated with char- acteristic vegetative and cognitive symptoms; however, the cognitive symptoms of persistent depression are less severe (e.g., low self-esteem rather than worthlessness, hopelessness rather than suicidality). Persis- tent depressive disorder is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe Overall, the clinical presentation of major and persistent depres- sive disorders in children and adolescents is similar to that in adults. The prominence of the symptoms can change with age: irritability and somatic complaints may be more common in children, and energy. activity level, appetite, and sleep disturbances may be more common in adolescents. Because of the cognitive and linguistic immaturity of young children, symptoms of depression in that age group may be more likely to be observed than self-reported The core feature of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is severe, persistent irritability evident most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 12 months in multiple settings (at home, at school, with peers). The irritable mood is interspersed

E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode. with frequent (≥3 times/week) and severe temper outbursts (verbal rages, physical aggression; Table 39.3). This diagnosis is intended to characterize more accurately the extreme irritability, which some investigators had considered a developmental presentation of bipo- lar disorder, and to distinguish extreme irritability from the milder presentations characteristic of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and intermittent explosive disorder. Table 39.4 highlights some of the similarities and differences between the various mood disorders and also factors that distinguish mood disorders from grief experi- enced in response to loss. Other specified/unspecified depressive disorder (subsyndromal depressive disorder) applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive disorder are present and cause clini- cally significant distress or functional impairment but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in this diagnostic class. EPIDEMIOLOGY The current prevalence of depressive disorder in the United States among 3-17 year olds is approximately 3.2%; the lifetime prevalence rates increase to 4.9% for ages 6-17 and to 12.8% for 12-17 year olds. The male:female ratio (excluding DMDD) is approximately 1:1 during childhood and beginning in early adolescence rises to 1:1.5-3.0 by adulthood. Based on rates of chronic and severe persistent irritability, which is the core feature of DMDD, the overall 6 month to 1 year prevalence has been estimated in the 2-5% range. In three community samples, the 3-month prevalence rate of DMDD ranged from 0.8-3.3%, with the highest rates occurring in preschoolers (although Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-5] does not permit this diagnosis until age 6 years). Approximately 5-10% of chil- dren and adolescents are estimated to have subsyndromal (unspeci- fied) depression. 

256 Part Ill • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS Models of vulnerability to depressive disorders are grounded in genetic and environmental pathways. Genetic studies have demonstrated the heritability of depressive disorders, with monozygotic twin studies find- ing concordance rates of 40-65%. In families, both bottom-up (children to parents) and top-down (parents to children) studies have shown a two- to four-fold bidirectional increase in depression among first- degree relatives. Cerebral variations in structure and function (particu- larly serotonergic), the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, difficult temperament/personality (i.e., negative affectivity), and ruminative, self-devaluating cognitive style have been implicated as components of biologic vulnerability. The great majority of depressive disorders arise in youth with long-standing psychosocial difficulties, among the most predictive of which are physical/sexual abuse, neglect, chronic illness, school difficulties (bullying, academic failure), social isolation, family or marital disharmony, divorce/separation, parental psychopathology, and domestic violence. Longitudinal studies demon- strate the greater importance of environmental influences in children who become depressed than in adults who become depressed. Factors shown to be protective against the development of depression include better family function, a prosocial peer group, higher IQ, greater edu- cational aspirations, a positive relationship with a caregiver, and closer caregiver supervision, monitoring, and involvement. SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS Screening Adolescents presenting in the primary care setting should be queried, along with their caregivers), about depressed mood as part of the rou- tine clinical interview. A typical screening question would be, "Every- one feels sad or angry some of the time; how about you (or your teen)?"

Key symptoms of Diag- nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM)- 5 for major depressive disorder. For a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, the individual needs to present with five or more of any of the symptoms nearly every day during the same 2-week period, pro- vided at least one of these symptoms is a fundamental one. The clinical symptoms of major depressive disorder are usually accompanied by functional impairment. The greater the number and severity of symp- toms (as opposed to particular symptoms), the greater the probability of the functional impairment they are likely to confer. The symptoms of depression can be grouped into emotional, neurovegetative, and neurocognitive domains. Importantly sleep, weight, and appetite are usually diminished in depression but can also be increased, and sui- cidal ideation, plans, or an attempt should be documented whenever depression is suspected. (From Malhi GS, Mann JJ. Depression. Lancet. 2018;392(10161):2299-2312:Fig. 1, p. 2300.) Illness pattern Single episode • Recurrent episode Rapid cycling • Seasonal Major depressive disorder specifiers the primary care setting (e.g., Pediatric Symptom Checklist, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scales) have items specific to sad mood and as such can be used to focus the interview. Additionally, screening tools specific to depression, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Beck Depression Inventory, can be utilized as part of routine screening (Table 39.5). The role of universal depression screening using standardized depression-specific instruments is unclear. A Cochrane review found that the use of depression screening in primary care has little or no impact on the recognition, management, or outcome of depression. Nonetheless, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recom- mends the universal use of depression screening instruments, but only among adolescents and only when systems are in place to ensure ade- quate follow-up. Targeted screening of known high-risk groups (e.g., youth who are homeless, refugees, attracted to the same sex, involved with child welfare or juvenile justice), or youth experiencing known psychosocial adversities or self-reporting a dysphoric mood, may be a higher-yield case-finding strategy than universal screening. Assessment Youth (and/or their caregivers) presenting in the primary care setting who self-report, or respond affirmatively to queries about a distressing life experience or a depressed or irritable mood should be offered the opportunity to talk about the situation with the pediatric practitioner (separately with the older youth). By engaging in active listening (e.g., Clinical features Anxious distress - Mixed features - Atypical - Melancholic Catatonic Psychotic - Mild - Moderate • Severe Mood congruent Mood incongruent Remission status Partial • Full Onset - Early Late Severity - Mild - Moderate - Severe Postpartum Fig. 39.3 Major depressive disorder specifiers. Episodes of major depression can be described in greater depth by specifiers (outlined in Diagnos- tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5]) that provide additional information regarding the pattern of the illness and its clinical features. Specifiers can also indicate the severity of the episode, when it first emerged (onset), and whether it has remitted (status). For exam- ple, in clinical practice, a typical episode of depression can be described as suffering from a recurrence of depression that is moderately severe with melancholic features and has partly remitted in response to initial treatment. (From Malhi GS, Mann JJ. Depression. Lancet. 2018;392[10161]:2299- 2312:Fig. 2, p. 2301.) 

Table 39.2 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Persistent Depressive Disorder A. Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, as indicated either by subjective account or observation by others, Note: In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable and duration must be at least 1 yr. B. Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the following: 1. Poor appetite or overeating. 2. Insomnia or hypersomnia. 3. Low energy or fatigue. 5. Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions. 6. Feelings of hopelessness. C. During the 2 yr period (1 yr for children or adolescents) of the disturbance, the individual has never been without the symptoms in Criteria A and B for more than 2 mo at a time. D. Criteria for a major depressive disorder may be continuously E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode, and criteria have never been met for cyclothymic disorder. F. The disturbance is not better explained by a persistent schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. G. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism). H. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Note: Because the criteria for a major depressive episode include four symptoms that are absent from the symptom list for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), a very limited number of individuals will have depressive symptoms that have persisted longer than 2 yr but will not meet criteria for persistent depressive disorder. If full criteria for a major depressive episode have been met at some point during the current episode of illness, they should be given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Otherwise, a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive disorder is warranted. From the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. pp. 168-169.

"I hear how upset you have been feeling; tell me more about what hap- pened to make you feel that way"), the clinician can begin to assess the onset, duration, context, and severity of the symptoms and associated dangerousness, distress, and functional impairment. In the absence of acute dangerousness (e.g., suicidality, psychosis, substance abuse) and significant distress or functional impairment, the pediatric practitioner can schedule a follow-up appointment within 1-2 weeks to conduct a depression assessment. At this follow-up visit, to assist with decision- making about appropriate level of care, a depression-specific screening or standardized rating scale can be administered to assess symptom severity (see Table 39.5), and additional risk factors can be explored. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS A number of psychiatric disorders, general medical conditions, and medications can generate symptoms of depression or irritability and must be distinguished from the depressive disorders. The psychiatric disorders include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, and bipo- lar, anxiety, trauma- and stressor-related, disruptive/impulse control/ conduct, and substance-related disorders. Medical conditions include neurologic disorders (including autoimmune encephalitis), endocrine disorders (including hypothyroidism and Addison disease), infectious diseases, tumors, anemia, uremia, failure to thrive, chronic fatigue dis- order, and pain disorder. Medications include narcotics, chemotherapy agents, ß blockers, corticosteroids, and contraceptives. The diagnosis Chapter 39 • Mood Disorders 257 Table 39.3 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder A.

B. The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. c. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week. D. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers). E.

By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria A-E is before 10 yr. I. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met. Note: Developmentally appropriate mood elevation, such as occurs in the context of a highly positive event or its anticipation, should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania. J. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia]). Note: The diagnosis cannot coexist with oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, or bipolar disorder, though it can coexist with others, including major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and substance use disorders. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned. K. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance or to another medical or neurologic condition.

American Psychiatric Association. of a depressive disorder should be made after these and other potential explanations for the observed symptoms have been ruled out. COMORBIDITY Major and persistent depressive disorders often co-occur with other psychiatric disorders. Depending on the setting and source of refer- ral, 40-90% of youths with a depressive disorder have other psychiatric disorders, and up to 50% have two or more comorbid diagnoses. The most common comorbid diagnosis is an anxiety disorder and as such may reflect a common diathesis; other common comorbidities include ADHD and disruptive behavior, eating, and substance use disorders. The development of depressive disorders can both lead to and follow the development of comorbid disorders. DMDD may occur with other psychiatric disorders, including other depressive disorders, ADHD, conduct disorder, and substance use dis- orders. Because the symptoms of DMDD overlap in part with symp- toms of bipolar disorder, ODD, and intermittent explosive disorder, by DSM-5 convention, hierarchical diagnostic rules apply. Thus bipolar disorder takes precedence over DMDD if a manic/hypomanic episode

TREATMENT Treatment decisions should be guided by the understanding that depression in youth is highly responsive to placebo (50-60%) or brief nonspecific intervention (15-30%). The goal of treatment is remission, defined as a period of at least 2 weeks with no or very few depressive symptoms, and ultimately recovery, defined as a period of at least 2 months with no or very few depressive symptoms. Assessment of remission and recovery can be aided using the depression-specific standardized rating scales, in which remission is defined as scores below the scale-specific clinical cut point. For mild symptoms (manageable and not functionally impairing) and in the absence of major risk factors (e.g., suicidality; psychosis; substance use; history of depression, mania, or traumatic exposures; parental psychopathology, particularly depression; severe family dysfunction), guided self-help (anticipatory guidance) with watch- ful waiting and scheduled follow-up may suffice. Guided self-help AGE RANGE (YR) 13+ 7-14 6-18 6-18 7-17 7-13 7-18 12/13+ 3-5.6 8-17 (youth report) or 5-17 (parent report) 8-13 11-20 ITEMS (NO.) 21 20 20 47 28/17/12 18 33-34 9 20 8/6 30 30 can include provision of educational materials (e.g., pamphlets, books, workbooks, apps, internet sites) that provide information to the youth about coping adaptively with stressful situations, as well as advice to caregivers about strengthening the caregiver- child relationship and moditying triggering exposures (e.g., taking action against bullying, increasing opportunities for social interac- tion and support, protecting child from exposure to marital dis- cord). Additional self-help activities that have shown promise in improving mild depressive symptoms include behavioral activation (e.g., physical exercise, social engagement, participation in a hobby), mindfulness (e.g., yoga, meditation), and a regular sleep schedule. For youths who continue to have mild depression after a few weeks of guided self-help, supportive therapy by a mental health profes- sional may be an appropriate subsequent step. For youths who have not responded to approximately 4-8 weeks of supportive psychother- apy, or who from the outset exhibit moderate to severe, comorbid, or recurrent depression or suicidality, or who have a history of mania, traumatic exposures, or severe family dysfunction or psychopathology, 

assessment and treatment by a child-trained mental health clinician should be obtained. For moderate to severe depression, specific manualized psychothera- pies, antidepressant medication, or a combination of both should be considered. There is insufficient evidence on which to base definitive conclusions about the relative effectiveness of these treatments. Psychotherapies Clinical trials of acute treatments have generated support for the effi- cacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)/behavioral activation therapy and interpersonal therapy as monotherapies in depressed youth, but overall effect sizes are modest. CBT focuses on identifying and correcting cognitive distortions that may lead to depressed mood and teaches problem-solving, behavior activation, social communica- tion, and emotional regulation skills to combat depression. Interper- sonal therapy focuses on enhancing interpersonal and social communication to decrease interpersonal conflicts. Each of these therapies typically involves 8-12 weekly visits. Limited evidence suggests that family therapy may be more effective than no treatment in decreasing depression and improving family functioning. Manual- ized CBT treatment as well as alternative therapy modalities such as play therapy are also available for younger children. Pharmacologic Treatment Two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), fluoxetine and escitalopram, are the only antidepressants approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of depression in youth; fluoxetine alone is approved for preadolescents. Other SSRIs, with the exception of paroxetine, which has been shown to be ineffec- tive in children, are frequently used off-label and may be considered for use in depressed children and teens despite the lack of FDA approval. There are several considerations to keep in mind when starting an SKI, including family history of response to SKIs, comorbid medical conditions, and other concurrent medications. Fluoxetine should be given in the morning, given its propensity to be activating for some patients; escitalopram is preferentially dosed in the evening as it can be sedating. Sertraline has the advantage of a very wide dosing range, which can be helpful when small dosing changes are preferred. All SSRIs carry a "black box" warning for increased suicidal thinking in patients under age 25 that must be discussed with all patients and caregivers before starting an SSRI. The risk for this side effect is high- est when initiating treatment and when making dose adjustments. All SSRIs can cause akathisia, an uncomfortable feeling of internal restless- ness; this side effect is more common in children than it is in adults. Gastrointestinal upset and headaches are among the most common side effects; they typically self-resolve after a few weeks. However, they may recur when dose increases are made. Education around the expected course and resolution of these side effects can be helpful when provid- ing informed consent and may lead to improved adherence in the early phase of treatment. Sexual side effects of SSRIs, including decreased libido and difficulty reaching orgasm, are also important considerations and should be addressed with patients before treatment initiation. If the first trial of an SSRI is unsuccessful, a trial of a second SSRI should be considered. An adequate trial of an SSRI requires that a suffi- cient dose be achieved and that it be continued for a reasonable amount of time. Given the length of time it takes for SSRIs to take full effect, an adequate trial would be at least 6-8 weeks at a target dose. Trials may end early if patients experience intolerable side effects. For patients who do not respond to two adequate trials of an SSRI, it is appropriate to consider referral to a psychiatrist for further management. Clinical severity, comorbidity, family conflict, low drug concentra- tion, nonadherence, anhedonia, sleep difficulties, subsyndromal manic symptoms, and child maltreatment have all been related to treatment resistance. Approximately 50% of depressed youth failing to respond to the hrst SoRl respond after switching to a second antidepressant plus CBT, vs approximately 40% who respond to a second medication alone. For youth with psychotic depression, augmenting the antidepressant with an atypical antipsychotic medication should be considered, while monitoring closely for side effects. Chapter 39 • Mood Disorders 259 Because of the high rate of recurrence, successful treatment should continue for 6-12 months. The findings from one trial suggested that the addition of relapse-prevention CBT to ongoing medication man- agement reduces the risk of relapse more than medication management alone, even after the end of treatment. When treatment concludes, all antidepressants (except possibly fluoxetine because of its long half-life) should be discontinued gradually to avoid withdrawal symptoms (gas- trointestinal upset, disequilibrium, sleep disruption, flulike symptoms, sensory disturbances). Patients with recurrent (two or more episodes), chronic, or severe major depression may require treatment beyond 12 months. Ketamine or esketamine, glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists have demonstrated efficacy in treating treatment resistant depression in adults. There are no rigorous studies evaluating the effectiveness of phar- macologic or psychosocial treatment approaches to persistent depres- sive disorder or DMDD. The aforementioned treatments for MDD may prove helpful in persistent depressive disorder. In suspected cases of DMDD, child and adolescent psychiatry consultation may be helpful to clarify diagnosis and suggest treatment approaches. LEVEL OF CARE Most children and adolescents with mild to moderate depressive disor- ders can be safely and effectively treated as outpatients, provided that a clinically appropriate schedule of visits can be maintained through the phases of treatment. Inpatient treatment should be considered for youth who present with a substantial risk of suicide, serious self-harm, or self-neglect, or when the family is not able to provide an appropri- ate level of supervision or follow-up with outpatient treatment recom- mendations, or when comprehensive assessment for diagnostic clarity is needed. When considering inpatient admission for a young person with depression, the benefits of inpatient treatment need to be bal- anced against potential detrimental effects, such as separation from family and community support. CLINICAL COURSE Major depression may first appear at any age, but the likelihood of onset greatly increases with puberty. Incidence appears to peak in the 20s. The median duration of a major depressive episode is about 5-8 months for clinically referred youth and 3-6 months for community samples. The course is quite variable in that some individuals rarely or never experience remission, whereas others experience many years with few or no symptoms between episodes. Persistent depressive disorder often has an early and insidious onset and, by definition, a chronic course (average untreated duration in both clinical and com- munity samples: 3.5 years). Depressed children appear to be more likely to develop nondepres- sive psychiatric disorders in adulthood than depressive disorders. However, depression in adolescents has a probability of recurrence reaching 50-70% after 5 years. The persistence of even mild depres- sive symptoms during remission is a powerful predictor of recurrence; other negative prognostic factors include more severe symptoms, lon- ger time to remission, history of maltreatment, and comorbid psychi- atric disorders. Up to 20% of depressed adolescents develop a bipolar disorder; the risk is higher among adolescents who have a high genetic risk for bipolar disorder, who have psychotic depression, or who have had pharmacologically induced mania. SEQUELAE Approximately 60% of youths with MDD report thinking about suicide; 30% attempt suicide. Youths with depressive disorders are also at high risk of substance abuse, impaired family and peer relationships, early pregnancy, legal problems, educational and occupational underachieve- ment, and poor adjustment to life stressors, including physical illness. Children with DMDD have displayed elevated rates of social impair- ments, school suspension, and service use. Irritability in adolescence has predicted the development of major depressive and dysthymic dis- orders and generalized anxiety disorder (but not bipolar disorder) 20 years later, as well as lower educational attainment and income. 

260 Part III • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders PREVENTION Experimental trials have sought to demonstrate the effectiveness of psychologic or educational strategies in preventing the onset of depres- sive disorders in children and adolescents. These programs generally have provided information about the link between depressed mood, thoughts, and behaviors, as well as training in skills intended to modify these thoughts and behaviors. A Cochrane review found small effects of these programs on depression symptoms when implemented univer- sally vs no intervention, with selective programs targeted at high-risk groups performing better than universal programs; however, the effect of prevention programs was null compared with attention controls.

Kim The bipolar and related disorders include bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclo- thymic, and other specified/unspecified bipolar and related disorders, as well as bipolar and related disorder caused by another medical condition. A manic episode is characterized by a distinct period of at least 1 week in which there is an abnormally and persistently elevated, expan- sive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased goal- directed activity or energy that is present for most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary). The episode is associated with characteristic cognitive and behavioral symptoms, including disturbances in self-regard, speech, attention, thought, activ- ity, impulsivity, and sleep (Table 39.6). To diagnose bipolar I disorder, criteria must be met for at least one manic episode, and the episode must not be better explained by a psychotic disorder. The manic epi- sode may be preceded and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. Bipolar I disorder is rated as mild, moderate, or severe in the same way as the depressive disorders. To diagnose bipolar II disorder, criteria must be met for at least one hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode. A hypomanic episode is similar to a manic episode but is briefer (at least 4 days) and less severe (causes less impairment in functioning, is not associated with psychosis, and would not require hospitaliza- tion) (Table 39.7). In bipolar Il disorder, there must never have been a manic disorder, the episodes must not be better explained by a psy- chotic disorder, and the symptoms of depression or the unpredict- ability caused by frequent alternation between periods of depression and hypomania must cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment. Bipolar II disorder is also rated as mild, moderate, or severe. Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by a period of at least 1 year (in children and adolescents) in which there are numerous periods with hypomanic and depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode or a major depressive episode, respectively (Table 39.8). EPIDEMIOLOGY The lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder I among adults in the United States varies from 0.8-1.6%, and bipolar II carries a lifetime prevalence of around 1.1%. Bipolar I disorder affects males and females equally, whereas bipolar II disorder is more common in females. Life- time rates of mania among youth have ranged from 0.1-1.7%. The estimated annual number of U.S. office-based visits of youth with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder increased from 25 per 100,000 population in 1994-1995 to 1,003/100,000 in 2002-2003. U.S. hospital discharge diagnoses increased from 1.4 to 7.3/10,000 in 9-13-year-old children and from 5.1 to 20.4 per 10,000 in 14-19 year olds. These increases were not found in U.K. diagnoses or hospital discharges, raising ques- tions about whether bipolar disorder was being over-diagnosed in the Table 39.6 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for a Manic Episode A.

B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior: 1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hr of sleep). 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. 6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity). 7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business C. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.

American Psychiatric Association. United States, with resultant increases in prescribing of antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing medications. ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS Twin studies suggest the heritability of bipolar disorder may be 60-90%; shared and unique environmental factors may account for 30-40% and 10-20%, respectively. Offspring of parents with bipolar disorders are at high risk for early-onset bipolar disorders as well as anxiety and behavioral disorders and mood dysregulation. There is an average 10-fold increased risk among adult relatives of individuals with bipolar disorder, with the magnitude of risk increasing with the degree of kinship. Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia likely share a common genetic origin, reflected in familial co-aggregation of the two disorders. Studies to date suggest key roles for the amygdala, anterior paralim- bic cortices, and their connections in the emotional dysregulation of bipolar disorder. Some of these abnormalities are apparent by adoles- cence, whereas others appear to progress over adolescence into young adulthood. Dysthymic (sad), cyclothymic (labile), or hyperthymic (irritable) tem- peraments may presage eventual bipolar disorder. Premorbid anxiety and dysphoria also are common. Environmental factors such as irri- table and negative parenting styles, physical and sexual abuse, poor social support, and prenatal alcohol exposure may interact with genetic vulnerability to produce early onset of bipolar illness as well as negative prognostic indicators. Affective lability, in particular, has been associ- ated with high levels of childhood trauma, and gradual sensitization to stressors has been linked to episode recurrence. 

SCREENING Cardinal manic symptoms of elation, increased energy, and grandiosity occurring in adolescents as a discrete episode representing an unequiv- ocal and uncharacteristic change in functioning should alert pediat- ric practitioners to the possibility of bipolar disorder.

Note: A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiologic effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode diagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bipolar diathesis. Note: Criteria A-F constitute a hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

Chapter 39 • Mood Disorders 261 parent-completed versions of mania-specific rating scales (e.g., Gen- eral Behavior Inventory, Child Mania Rating Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale) have been associated with increased likelihood of a bipolar diag- nosis. However, screening tools for bipolar disorder have suboptimal psychometric properties when applied to young people. Because of the complexity of diagnosing and treating bipolar disorders, any suspected cases should be referred to the specialty mental health setting for com- prehensive assessment and treatment. PRESENTATION In adolescents, the clinical manifestations of mania are similar to those in adults; psychosis (delusions, hallucinations) often is an associated symptom (see Chapter 47). Mood in a manic episode is often described as euphoric, excessively cheerful, high, or "feeling on top of the world." During the episode, the adolescent may engage in multiple new proj- ects that are initiated with little knowledge of the topic and often at unusual hours (middle of the night). Inflated self-esteem is usually present, ranging from uncritical self-confidence to marked grandiosity, and may reach delusional proportions. The adolescent may sleep little, if at all, for days and still feel rested and full of energy. Speech can be rapid, pressured, and loud and characterized by jokes, puns, amusing irrelevancies, and theatricality. Frequently there is a "flight of ideas,, evidenced by an almost continuous flow of accelerated speech, with abrupt shifts from one topic to another. Distractibility is evidenced by an inability to censor irrelevant extraneous stimuli, which often pre- vents an individual with mania from engaging in a rational conversa- tion. The expansive mood, grandiosity, and poor judgment often lead to reckless involvement in activities with high potential for personal harm. Controversy surrounds the applicability of the diagnostic criteria for mania to prepubertal children. It may be developmentally normal for children to be elated, expansive, grandiose, or talkative, reducing the specificity of these symptoms to this disorder. In addition, the distract- ibility, overactivity, impulsivity, and irritability formerly ascribed to bipolar disorder by some investigators may be better explained by a diagnosis of ADHD, with or without comorbid ODD. The presentation of severe and pervasive irritability formerly diagnosed as "bipolar dis- order" may be better captured by the diagnosis of DMDD. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Numerous psychiatric disorders, general medical conditions, and medications can generate manic-like symptoms and must be distin- guished from the bipolar and related disorders. The psychiatric disor- ders include ADHD, ODD, and intermittent explosive, posttraumatic stress, depressive, anxiety, substance abuse, and borderline personality disorders. Medical conditions include neurologic disorders, endocrine disorders, infectious diseases, tumors, anemia, uremia, and vitamin deficiencies. Medications include androgens, bronchodilators, cardio- vascular medications, corticosteroids, chemotherapy agents, thyroid preparations, and certain psychiatric medications (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, stimulants). The diagnosis of a bipolar disorder should be made after these other explanations for the observed symptoms have been ruled out. Substance-induced mood disorder should also be considered and ruled out in patients presenting with mania.

262 Part Ill • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders For bipolar II disorder, the main differential is unipolar depression (MDD) or cyclothymic disorder, which are ruled out by the lack of a hypomanic episode and by not meeting full criteria for either a major depressive or hypomanic episode, respectively. COMORBIDITY The most common simultaneous comorbidities (ADHD, ODD, conduct disorder, anxiety) may be difficult to distinguish from mania because of considerable symptom overlap. Substance use also is a common comorbidity in adolescents, and presentations that appear to be manic may remit when the substances of abuse are discontinued. TREATMENT Pharmacologic Treatment Medication is the primary treatment for mania (Table 39.9). Studies have demonstrated the superiority of antipsychotics over mood stabi- lizers in the treatment of mania. Risperidone and olanzapine are the most efhcacious agents; quetiapine, risperidone, and olanzapine ranked as the most tolerable agents. The choice of antipsychotic medication is based on factors such as side effect profiles, comorbidities, adherence, Among traditional mood stabilizers, only lithium is FDA approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder from age 12 years; its efficacy and tolerability compared to placebo has been demonstrated in ran- domized controlled trials (RCTs). There also is evidence that lithium reduces the risk of suicide and total deaths in patients with both unipo- lar and bipolar depressive disorder. Given the co-occurrence of sleep disturbance with bipolar disorders, the use of medications to help regulate sleep can have a significant ben- efit on mood and functioning. Medications to promote sleep, includ- ing benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and melatonin receptor agonists have some evidence for the treatment of sleep in bipolar disorder in adults. When treating children and adolescents, it is important to monitor for paradoxical activation/disinhibition when using benzodiazepines. Medication trials should be systematic and their duration sufficient (generally 6-8 weeks) to determine effectiveness. Care should be taken to avoid unnecessary polypharmacy, in part by discontinuing agents that have not demonstrated significant benefit. Because these medica- tions are associated with significant side effects, careful monitoring of baseline and follow-up indices is imperative (see Chapter 33). The regimen needed to stabilize acute mania should be maintained for 12-24 months. Maintenance therapy is often needed for adolescents with bipolar I disorder, and some patients need lifelong medication. Any attempts to discontinue prophylactic medication should be done gradually while closely monitoring the patient for relapse. Antidepressants alone should not be prescribed for depressive symp- toms in confirmed cases of bipolar I disorder because of the risk of manic switch. For treatment of depression in bipolar II, antidepressant Table 39.9 MEDICATION Aripiprazole Asenapine Lithium Lurasidone Olanzapine Quetiapine Risperidone U.S. Food and Drug Administration-Approved Treatments for Bipolar Disorder in Youth INDICATION (APPROVED AGES) Mania (10-17 yr) Mania/mixed episode (10-17 yr) Acute mania/bipolar maintenance (7-17 yr) Bipolar depression (10-17 yr) Mania/mixed episode (13-17 yr) Mania (10-17 yr) Mania/mixed episode (10-17 yr) medication may be used cautiously. Comorbid ADHD can be treated with a stimulant once a mood stabilizer has been initiated. Psychotherapies Psychotherapy is a potentially important adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorders. Therapies with some evidence of efficacy, primarily as adjunctive to pharmacotherapy, include multifamily psychoeduca- tional psychotherapy and family-focused treatment, child and family- focused CBT, dialectical behavioral therapy, and interpersonal and social rhythm therapy. Active components of these therapies include family involvement and psychoeducation, along with self-regulation, cognitive restructuring, communication, problem-solving, and emo- tion regulation skills. Factors that adversely influence response to ther- apy include high-conflict families and sleep impairment, suggesting the importance of targeting these factors in treatment. Sleep hygiene is an important factor in the treatment of mania, and there is support for the use of CBT in treating insomnia related to bipolar disorder. Ensur- ing patients get adequate rest will help with recovery and the preven- tion of future episodes of mania. LEVEL OF CARE Most youths with bipolar disorders can be safely and effectively treated as outpatients, provided that an appropriate schedule of visits and labo- ratory monitoring can be maintained through the course of treatment. Youths who are suicidal, homicidal, psychotic, or present an inten- tional danger to themselves or others typically require inpatient care. Clinical Course and Prognosis The mean age of onset of the first manic episode is approximately 18 years old for bipolar I disorder. Premorbid problems are common in bipolar disorder, especially temperamental difficulties with mood and behavioral regulation. Premorbid anxiety also is common. The early course of adolescent-onset bipolar I disorder appears to be more chronic and refractory to treatment than adult-onset bipolar disorder. Comorbidity predicts functional impairment, and age at onset pre- dicts duration of episodes. Sleep impairment and family conflict are inversely related to favorable treatment response, suggesting impor- tant targets for treatment. The bipolar disorders are highly recurrent, and 70-80% of bipolar I patients will have additional mood episodes. Recurrent episodes can approximate 4 in 10 years, with the inter- episode interval shortening as the patient ages. Although the majority of patients with bipolar I return to a fully functional level between epi- sodes, approximately 30% continue to be symptomatic and function- ally impaired between episodes. The initial presentation of bipolar I disorder is often a major depres- sive episode. Switching trom a depressive episode to a manic episode by adulthood may occur in 10-20% of youth, both spontaneously and during depression treatment. Factors that predict the eventual devel- opment of mania in depressed youth include a depressive episode characterized by rapid onset, psychomotor retardation, and psychotic features; a family history of affective disorders, especially bipolar disor- der; and a history of mania or hypomania after antidepressant therapy. The mean age of onset of bipolar II disorder is 20 years old. The ill- ness most often begins with a depressive episode and is not recognized as bipolar II disorder until a hypomanic episode occurs, in about 12% of individuals with the initial diagnosis of major depression. Many individuals experience several episodes of major depression before experiencing the first recognized hypomanic episode. Anxiety, sub- stance misuse, or eating disorders may also precede the onset of bipolar II, complicating its detection. About 5-15% of individuals with bipolar Il disorder will ultimately develop a manic episode, which changes the diagnosis to bipolar I disorder. Depression in bipolar I or Il usually has an earlier age of onset, more frequent episodes of shorter duration, an abrupt onset and offset, is linked to comorbid substance misuse, and is triggered by stressors. Atypical symptoms such as hypersomnia, lability, and weight instabil- ity are also common in bipolar depression, reported in up to 90% of cases vs 50% in unipolar depression. Psychosis, psychomotor retarda- tion, and catatonia are also more characteristic of bipolar depression, 

whereas somatic complaints are more frequent in unipolar depression. A family history of mania is also a relevant discriminating factor. Provision of clinical services is poor for youth with bipolar disor- der. In one healthcare system study spanning 2-year follow-up after diagnosis, despite complex drug regimens, medication appointments were infrequent, averaging one visit every 2 months. More than 50% of patients needed one or more hospitalizations, and almost half had psychiatric emergency department visits. In a national study, 38% of youths diagnosed with bipolar disorder had received no treatment at all. Bipolar disorder has one of the higher rates of suicide among men- tal health diagnoses, with a lifetime risk of suicide in individuals with bipolar disorder estimated to be at least 15 times that of the general population. Factors associated with suicide attempts include female gender, young age at illness onset, depressive polarity of first illness episode or current or most recent episode, comorbid anxiety disorder, any comorbid substance use disorder, borderline personality disorder, and first-degree family history of suicide. In contrast, completed sui- cides are associated with male sex and a first-degree family history of suicide. Despite patients with bipolar disorder having normal or even superior cognition before diagnosis, bipolar disorder has been associ- ated with decrements in executive function and verbal memory. Youths with bipolar disorder are also at high risk for substance abuse, anti- social behavior, impaired academic performance, impaired family and peer relationships, and poor adjustment to life stressors. PREVENTION Although empirical support is sparse, one study demonstrated the effectiveness of family-focused treatment vs an educational control in hastening and sustaining recovery from mood symptoms in a high- familial-risk cohort of youths with subsyndromal symptoms of mania. Family-focused treatment is a manualized psychoeducational inter- vention designed to reduce family stress, conflict, and affective arousal by enhancing communication and problem solving between youths and their caregivers. Pharmacologic interventions for subsyndromal mania have produced equivocal results. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. Chapter 40 Suicide and Attempted Suicide Jennifer A. Zaspel and Rosa K. Kim Youth suicide is a major public health concern. In 2021, suicide was the second leading cause of death in adolescents and young adults (aged 10-24 years) and the tenth leading cause of death for all ages. The rates have also increased over time, with a 2.5-fold increase in suicide- related visits in adolescents. There are numerous genetic, psychiatric, social, cultural, and environmental risk factors for suicidal behavior (Fig. 40.1). There are also many protective factors and interventions that can reduce rates of self-injury and suicide. Knowledge of these risk factors and protective factors may facilitate identification and treat- ment in youths at highest risk for intentional harm to themselves. Chapter 40 • Suicide and Attempted Suicide 263 EPIDEMIOLOGY Suicide rates for children and adolescents have been increasing over time, with the overall suicide rates increasing by 35% since 1999. It is estimated that 46% of people who die by suicide were diagnosed with a psychiatric condition at the time of their death. Linear trends in suicide attempts from 2009-2019 have also increased and specifically among certain demographic groups. A better understanding of which groups are at risk for suicide and parasuicidal behavior can help pediatricians identify and support those who are at risk (Table 40.1). Suicidal Ideation and Attempts More than 30% of 9th- 12th grade students in the United States felt so sad or hopeless almost every day for 2 or more weeks in a row dur- ing the previous year that they stopped doing usual activities. During that same period, 18.8% of the students reported that they had seri- ously considered attempting suicide, and 8.9% reported that they had attempted suicide one or more times. A suicide attempt in the previ- ous year that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had to be treated by a physician or nurse was reported by 2.5% of students. Ingestion is the most common method of attempted suicide. The 15-19-year-old age-group is the most likely to intentionally harm them- selves by ingestion, receive treatment in the ED, and survive. Attempts are more common in adolescent females than males and in Hispanic females than their non-Hispanic counterparts. LGBTQ+ and bullied youths also have disproportionately high rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (see Chapter 154). Prior self-harm (self-injury) from poisoning, drowning, firearms, fires, asphyxiation (hanging), and traffic injury are risk factors for suicide. Repeated episodes of self-harm are a higher risk factor than a single episode (see Chapter 46). Attempters who have made prior suicide attempts, who used a method other than ingestion, who have a plan, who have no regret, and who still want to die are at increased risk for completed suicide. Nonetheless, a significant number of children and adolescents who have completed suicide had no previous attempts. Suicide Completions In the United States, completed suicide is very rare before age 10. Rates of completed suicide increase steadily across adolescence into young adulthood, peaking in the early 20s. The male-to-female ratio for completed suicide rises with age from 3:1 in children to approxi- mately 4:1 in those aged 15-24 and greater than 6:1 among those ages 20-24. Although exact rates have changed over time, firearms, suffo- cation, and poisoning remain the most common methods of suicide For both male and female youth ages 15-24, suicide rates remain highest among Indigenous American and Indigenous Alaskan youth and White youth relative to Black, Asian or Pacific Islander, and His- panic youth. However, rates have been rising for both Black and Asian or Pacific Islander youth, with the rates in Black males increasing 47% between 2013 and 2019 (12.2/100,000 to 17.9/100,000 individu- als) and Asian or Pacific Islander males increasing 40% between 2013 and 2019 (12.0/100,000 to 16.8/100,000 individuals). Similar increases have also been seen in female youth in these groups in this time, with a rate increase of 59% among Black female youth (2.7 to 4.3/100,000) and 42% among Asian or Pacific Islander (3.6 to 5.1/100,000). In 2021, the combined (male and female, age 10-24) suicide rates among Indig- enous youths increased ~16% (over 2018 rates); Increases were also noted among Black youths (~36%) and Hispanic youths (~8%). RISK FACTORS Multiple risk factors predispose youth to suicide (see Fig. 40.1, Table 40.1). Dynamic risk factors are those that change over time and are most amenable to risk mitigation through treatment, resources, and support. Static risk factors are those that increase an individual's risk of suicide attempt and completion but are not amenable to direct inter- vention. They include genetic factors, demographic information, an individual's past psychiatric history, family psychiatric history, and history of suicidal and parasuicidal behavior. The risk associated with each factor varies, with the highest risk associated with a personal

The strength of the association between each risk factor and suicide is indicat- ed by the shading (darker shad- ing indicates a stronger associa- tion). (From Fazel S, Runeson B. appears in. N Engl J Med. 2020 Mar 12;382:1078); N Engl J Med. 2020;382:266-274:Fig. 1, p 267.) history of a suicide attempt. Risk is also cumulative, with childhood adversity leading to an increased lifetime risk of suicide. Access to Firearms Firearms are the most lethal method of suicide completion; the death rate with respect to firearms is approximately 80-90%, whereas the death rate is only 1.5-4% for drug overdoses. Firearms have long been the most common method of completed suicide across all ages and genders and have become the most common method of suicide com- pletion for adolescent males (see Fig. 40.2). Limiting access to lethal means, in particular firearms, reduces rates of completed suicide. Suicide Contagion Suicide attempts may also be precipitated by exposure to news of another person's suicide or by reading about or viewing a suicide por- trayed in a romantic light in the media. Media coverage of suicide is linked to fluctuating incidence rates of suicides, particularly among adolescents. Glorification of suicide whether in news or in fictional media has been associated with an increase in suicides. When media coverage includes a detailed description of specific means used, the use of that particular method may increase in the overall population. Preexisting Psychiatric Illness Approximately 90% of youths who complete suicide have a preexist- ing psychiatric illness, most often major depression. Among females, chronic anxiety, especially panic disorder, also is associated with sui- cide attempts and completion. Among males, conduct disorder and substance use confer increased risk. Comorbidity of a substance use disorder, a depressive disorder, and/or conduct disorder are linked to suicide by firearm. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are linked to sui- cide attempts and completions (see Chapter 47.1). Suicidal and Parasuicidal Behavior History of a previous suicide attempt is recognized as the strongest pre- dictive risk factor for future suicidal behavior. Individual definitions of suicide attempts can vary; therefore parasuicidal behavior should be explored when considering past attempts. Some patients may not consider an aborted attempt or interrupted attempt an actual suicide attempt, but these behaviors carry considerable risk, as do researching suicide methods, preparatory acts, rehearsals, giving away possessions, and making arrangements for responsibilities (e.g., hnding someone else to care for a pet or family member in their planned absence). Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is the direct and deliberate destruc- tion of one's own body tissue with the absence of intent to die (see Chap- ter 46). The most common self-harm behavior is cutting or carving, but other behaviors include scratching, burning, punching or hitting one- self, biting, and others. NSSI is common among adolescents, especially females. Up to 47.4% of youth with a diagnosis of depression engage in NSSI, and lifetime prevalence rates of NSSI are between 17% and 60%. Although the intent of these behaviors may not be to cause death, they are important to note, as they are strong predictors of future suicidality if left untreated. Seventy percent of adolescents who engaged in NSSI report a lifetime suicide attempt, and 55% reported multiple attempts. Individuals who are most likely to engage in NSSI are those who have a family member or close friend who have engaged in self-harm and those who believe that peers engage in self-harm. Protective Factors Protective factors (Table 40.2) can provide a counterbalance for those contemplating suicide. Internal protective factors are those that are inherent to the individual. External protective factors are typically dependent on relationships and interactions with others. Protective factors, even if present, may not counteract significant acute risk. ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION All suicidal ideation (including planning) and suicide attempts should be taken seriously and require a thorough assessment by a child-trained mental health clinician to evaluate the youth's current state of mind, ongoing risk of harm, and next best steps in treatment. Emergency mental health assessment is needed for immediate threat to self (i.e., active suicidal ideation with plan and intent); urgent mental health assessment (48-72 hours) is needed for severe psychiatric symptoms, significant change in overall functioning, and suicidal ideation with- out intent or plan. Routine mental health assessment is appropriate for mild to moderate psychiatric symptoms without suicidal ideation. Pediatric practitioners should expect the mental health clinician to evaluate the presence and degree of suicidality and underlying risk fac- tors. The reliability and validity of child interviewing are affected by

Confirma- tion of the youth's suicidal behavior can be obtained from information gathered by interviewing others who know the child or adolescent. A discrepancy between patient and parent reports is not unusual, with both children and adolescents more likely to disclose suicidal ideation and suicidal actions than their parents. Suicide Inquiry In the mental health assessment, suicidal ideation is assessed by explicit questions posed in a nonjudgmental, noncondescending, matter-of-fact approach. The clinician should explore all aspects of Chapter 40 • Suicide and Attempted Suicide 265 suicidal ideation (i.e., frequency, intensity), suicide plan, parasuicidal behaviors like preparatory acts or writing notes, and intent associated with their thoughts. The assessment of a suicide attempt should also include a detailed exploration of the hours immediately preceding an attempt to identify precipitants as well as the circumstances of the attempt itself to better understand the patient's intent and potential lethality. It is important to recognize that suicidal ideation is dynamic in nature and should be considered on an individual basis; a patient should be compared to their own baseline when assessing for risk of harm to self. Children Under 12 Years Although suicidal ideation and attempts are less frequent in children under 12 than older teens and adults, they do occur. A developmen- tal approach must be taken, as children vary in their understanding of death, moral reasoning, and cognitive reasoning based on age and whether they are following a typical developmental trajectory. A young child may not recognize that their means are not lethal, but that fact should not discount their intent. Unlike adolescents, Black male children are most likely to complete suicide, most often by hanging or strangulation. Children who are at risk of suicide may be less likely to demonstrate classical symp- he es ay trangulion Citre complete toms of depression than teens and are more likely to attempt at home. Children who die by suicide have higher rates of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), emphasizing the importance of impulsivity in suicide attempts. Relationship problems are the most common precipitating circumstance, but the specific relationship dif- fers along developmental lines. Younger adolescents are more likely to have had relationship problems with peers or a significant other, whereas children are more likely to have had relationship problems with family. Determining Risk The calculation of the level of risk of harm to self is complex, requiring a determination across a spectrum of risk. At the low end of the risk spectrum are youth with thoughts of death or wanting to die but with- out suicidal thoughts, intent, or plan. Those with specific suicide plans, preparatory acts or suicide rehearsals, low probability of being found during an attempt, and clearly articulated intent are at the high end. A history of suicide attempts, presently impaired judgment, and poor social support further exacerbates the heightened risk. Among adoles- cents who consider self-harm, those who carry out self-injury are more likely to have family or friends who have engaged in self-harm. When considering all aspects of a suicide risk assessment, positive responses to a suicide inquiry carry more weight and concern than risk factors alone. Levels of Psychiatric Care For youth who are an imminent danger to themselves (i.e., have active thoughts of killing themselves with plan and intent), inpatient level of psychiatric care is necessary to ensure safety, clarify diagnoses, and plan comprehensive treatment. These patients can be hospitalized voluntarily or involuntarily. It is helpful for the pediatric practitioner to have an office protocol to follow in these situations. This protocol should take into consideration state laws regarding involuntary hospi- talization, transportation options, nearest emergency assessment site, necessary forms for hospitalization, and available emergency mental health consultants. For those youth suitable for treatment in the outpatient setting (e.g., suicidal ideation without plan or intent, intact mental sta- tus, few or no other risk factors for suicidality, willing and able to participate in outpatient treatment; has caregivers able to provide emotional support, supervision, safeguarding, and adherence to follow-up), an appointment should be scheduled within a few days with a mental health clinician. Ideally, this appointment should be scheduled before leaving the assessment venue. A procedure should be in place to contact the family to encourage mental health follow- up and provide additional support or resources, if needed. Some

Safety Planning Safety planning is a brief psychosocial intervention that has been shown to reduce suicidal behavior and increase engagement in treat- ment. Safety plan development consists of working ideally with both the patient and their caregivers to identify individual warning signs and symptoms related to self-harm and suicidal behavior, outlining healthy coping skills and people or places that can provide distraction, identifying loved ones and professionals who can be contacted dur- ing a crisis, and agreeing on ways to make the home environment safe (e.g., removing firearms, locking up medications). Studies have repeat- edly refuted the efficacy of safety or suicide contracts in mitigating risk of completing suicide, and some have shown them to be harmful to the therapeutic relationship.

The assessment is complicated by patients who may attempt to conceal their suicide thoughts and by those who express sui- cidal thoughts without serious intent. Suicide screening has been challenging because most screening instruments have variable sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the follow-up mental health evaluations for those who screen positive has been poor. Prevention strategies in the pediatric medical home include training staff to recognize and respond to the warning signs of sui- cide (Table 40.3), screening for and treating depression, educating 

patients/parents about warning signs for suicide, and restricting access to lethal means. Pediatric practitioners should consider counseling parents to remove firearms from the home entirely or securely lock guns and ammunition in separate locations. Anec- dotal evidence suggests youths frequently know where guns and keys to gun cabinets are kept, even though parents may think they do not. The same recommendation applies to restricting access to potentially lethal prescription and nonprescription medications (e.g., containers of >25 acetaminophen tablets) and alcohol. These approaches emphasize the importance of restriction of access to means of suicide to prevent self-harm. Chapter 40 • Suicide and Attempted Suicide 267 SCREENING AND EARLY TREATMENT In 2022, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) con- cluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal suicide screening in the primary care setting for children and ado- lescents. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend universal suicide screening for all children ≥12 years old. In addi- tion, in 2018 the American Academy of Pediatrics and the USPFTS (2022) recommended annual universal depression screening for youths 12 and older, which often includes suicide screening as part of validated tools. Pediatric practitioners should also consider sui- cide potential and the need for mental health assessment in the NIMH TOOLKIT asle Ask Suicide-Screening Questions Suicide Risk Screening Tool Ask the patient: 1.

The Ask Suicide-Screening Questionnaire (ASQ) is a validated four-item measure shown in the ED setting to have high sensitivity and negative predictive value in identifying youth at risk for suicide ideation and behavior (Fig. 40.3). Other common screening tools are the Columbia Sui- cide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Screener (Table 40.4) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2/PHQ-9). These scales have also been used in the emergency room setting. Through follow-up office visits, pediatric practitioners can help support and facilitate the implementation of psychotherapies that target the specific psychiatric disorders and the emotional dyspho- ria or behavioral dysregulation that accompany suicidal ideation or behavior. In conjunction with a child and adolescent psychiatrist, psychotropic medications may be used as indicated to treat under- lying psychiatric disorders. Both dialectical behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are effective in reducing harm but must be combined with appropriate psychopharmacology of an underlying disorder. Pediatric practitioners also can encourage social connectedness to peers and to community organizations, as well as promote help-seeking (e.g., talking to a trusted adult when distressed) and wellness behaviors. In the event of a completed sui- cide, pediatricians can offer support to the family, particularly by monitoring for pathologic bereavement responses in siblings and SCHOOL RESOURCES Screening for suicide in schools is also fraught with problems related to low specificity of screening instruments, paucity of referral sites, and variable acceptability among school administrators. Gatekeeper (e.g., student support personnel) training appears effective in improving skills among school personnel and is highly acceptable to administra- tors but has not been shown to prevent suicide. School curricula (e.g., Signs of Suicide) have shown some preventive potential by teaching students to recognize the signs of depression and suicide in themselves and others and providing them with specific action steps necessary for responding to these signs. Peer helpers have not generally been shown to be efficacious. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. Chapter 41 Eating Disorders Taylor B. Starr and Richard E. Kreipe Eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by body dissatisfaction related to overvaluation of a thin body ideal, associated with dysfunc- tional patterns of cognition and weight control behaviors that result in significant biologic, psychologic, and social complications. EDs can develop in individuals of any age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or cultural background. Early intervention in EDs improves outcome. DEFINITIONS Anorexia nervosa (AN) involves significant overestimation of body size and shape, with a relentless pursuit of thinness that, in the restric- tive subtype, typically combines excessive dieting and compulsive exercising. In the binge-purge subtype, patients might intermittently overeat and then attempt to rid themselves of calories by vomiting or taking laxatives, still with a strong drive for thinness (Table 41.1). Bulimia nervosa (BN) is characterized by episodes of eating large amounts of food in a brief period, followed by compensatory vomiting, laxative use, exercise, or fasting to rid the body of the effects of overeat- ing in an effort to avoid obesity (Table 41.2). Children and adolescents with EDs may not fulfill criteria for AN or BN in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and may fall into a subcategory of Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorders (OSFED). Youth with these subthresh- old conditions merit close monitoring over time because they may be early in the course of an illness. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) involves limiting food intake based on the subjective qualities of food (e.g., appearance, color, smell, taste, texture or consistency), fear of adverse consequences of eating (e.g., choking, gagging or vomiting), or lack of interest in eat- ing, but without concern about body image, weight, shape, or size. However, significant unintended weight loss or nutritional deficiencies and problems with social interactions can occur as a result (Table 41.3). Binge eating disorder (BED), in which binge eating is not followed regularly by any compensatory behaviors (vomiting, laxatives), is a stand-alone category in DSM-5 but shares many features with obesity (see Chapter 65). 

Chapter 41 • Eating Disorders 269 Table 41.1 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Anorexia Nervosa A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected. B. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight. C. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self- evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight. Specify whether: Restricting type (ICD-10-CM code F50.01): During the last 3 mo, the individual has not engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). This subtype describes presentations in which weight loss is accomplished primarily through dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise. Binge-eating/purging type (ICD-10-CM code F50.02): During the last 3 mo, the individual has engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). Specify if: In partial remission: After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were previously met, Criterion A (low body weight) has not been met for a sustained period, but either Criterion B (intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat or behavior that interferes with weight gain) or Criterion C (disturbances in self-perception of weight and shape) is still met. In full remission: After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were previously met, none of the criteria has been met for a sustained period of time. Specify current severity: The minimum level of severity is based, for adults, on current BMI (see the following) or, for children and adolescents, on BMI percentile. The ranges below are derived from World Health Organization categories for thinness in adults; for children and adolescents, corresponding BMI percentiles should be used. The level of severity may be increased to reflect clinical symptoms, the degree of functional disability, and the need for supervision. Mild: BMI ≥17 kg/m?

An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following: 1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2 hr period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under 2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating). B. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise. c. Dot incur, oring erage, at eatine a mentoro mehaviors D. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight. E. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa. Specify if: In partial remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were previously met, some, but not all, of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time. In full remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were previously met, none of the criteria has been met for a sustained period of time. Specify current severity: The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of inappropriate compensatory behaviors (see the following). The level of severity may be increased to reflect other symptoms and the degree of functional disability. Mild: An average of 1-3 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week. Moderate: An average of 4-7 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week. Severe: An average of 8-13 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week. Extreme: An average of 14 or more episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week. From the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. p. 345. Copyright 2013. American Psychiatric Association. EPIDEMIOLOGY The classic presentation of AN is an early to middle adolescent female of above-average intelligence and socioeconomic status who is a conflict-avoidant, risk-aversive perfectionist and is struggling with dis- turbances of anxiety and/or mood. BN tends to emerge in later adoles- cence, sometimes evolving from AN, and is typified by impulsivity and features of borderline personality disorder associated with depression and mood swings. ARFID typically presents in late childhood, is more common in males, and more often co-occurs with anxiety disorders and autism spectrum disorder. The 0.5-1% and 3-5% incidence rates among younger and older adolescent females for AN and BN, respec- tively, probably reflect ascertainment bias in sampling and underdiag- nosis in cases not fitting the common profile. The same may be true of the significant gender disparity, in which female patients account for approximately 85% of patients with diagnosed EDs. No single factor causes the development of an ED; sociocultural studies indicate a complex interplay of culture, ethnicity, gender, peers, and family. The gender dimorphism is presumably related to females having a stronger relationship between body image and self-evaluation, as well as the influence of the Western culture's thin body ideal. Eth- nicity appears to moderate the association between risk factors and disordered eating, with African American and Caribbean females reporting lower body dissatisfaction and less dieting than Hispanio and non-Hispanic White females. Because peer acceptance is central to healthy adolescent growth and development, especially in early adoles- cence, when AN tends to have its initial prevalence peak, the potential influence of peers on EDs is significant, as are the relationships among peers, body image, and eating. Teasing by peers or by family members (especially males) may be a contributing factor for overweight females.

An eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in eating or food; avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of food; concern about aversive consequences of eating) as manifested by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs associated with one (or more) of the following: 1. Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children). 2. Significant nutritional deficiency. 3. Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional 4. Marked interference with psychosocial functioning. B. The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food or by an associated culturally sanctioned practice. C. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced. D. The eating disturbance is not attributable to a concurrent medical condition or not better explained by another mental disorder. When the eating disturbance occurs in the context of another condition or disorder, the severity of the eating disturbance exceeds that routinely associated with the condition or disorder and warrants additional clinical attention. Specify if: In remission: After full criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder were previously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained period of time. From the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. p. 334. Copyright 2013. American Psychiatric Association. Family influence in the development of EDs is even more complex because of the interplay of environmental and genetic factors; shared elements of the family environment and immutable genetic factors account for approximately equal amounts of the variance in disordered eating. There are associations between parents' and children's eating behaviors; dieting and physical activity levels suggest parental rein- forcement of body-related societal messages. The influence of inherited genetic factors on the emergence of EDs during adolescence is also sig- nificant, but not directly. Rather, the risk for developing an ED appears to be mediated through a genetic predisposition to anxiety (see Chap- ter 38), depression (see Chapter 39), or obsessive-compulsive traits that may be modulated through the internal milieu of puberty. There is no evidence to support the outdated notion that parents or family dynam- ics cause an ED; rather, the family dynamics may represent responses to having a family member with a potentially life-threatening condi- tion. The supportive influence on recovery of parents as nurturing caregivers cannot be overestimated. PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS The emergence of EDs coinciding with the processes of adolescence (e.g., puberty, identity, autonomy, cognition) indicates the central role of development. EDs may be viewed as a final common path- way, with a number of predisposing factors that increase the risk of developing an ED, precipitating factors often related to develop- mental processes of adolescence triggering the emergence of the ED, and perpetuating factors that cause an ED to persist. A history of sexual trauma is more common in children with BN, and when present with any ED makes recovery more difficult. EDs often begin with dieting but gradually progress to unhealthy habits that lessen the negative impact of associated psychosocial problems to which the affected person is vulnerable because of premorbid biologic and psychologic characteristics, family interactions, and social climate. When persistent, the biologic effects of starvation and malnutrition (e.g., true loss of appetite, hypothermia, gastric atony, amenorrhea, sleep disturbance, fatigue, weakness, depression), combined with the psychologic rewards of increased sense of mastery and reduced emotional reactivity, actually maintain and reward pathologic ED This positive reinforcement of behaviors and consequences, gen- erally viewed by parents and others as negative, helps to explain why persons with an ED characteristically deny that a problem exists and resist treatment. With significantly low caloric intake, patients ini- tially exhibit extreme irritability, but over time experience emotional "numbness"" which reinforces continued caloric restriction. Although noxious, purging can be reinforcing because of a reduction in anxi- ety triggered by overeating; purging also can result in short-term, but reinforcing, improvement in mood related to changes in neurotrans- mitters. In addition to an imbalance in neurotransmitters, most nota- bly serotonin and dopamine, alterations in functional anatomy also support the concept of EDs as brain disorders. The cause-and-effect relationship in central nervous system (CNS) alterations in EDs is not clear, nor is their reversibility. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Except for ARFID, in which weight loss is unintentional, a central fea- ture of EDs is the overestimation of body size, shape, or parts (e.g., abdomen, thighs) leading to intentional weight control practices to reduce weight (AN) or prevent weight gain (BN). Associated practices include severe restriction of caloric intake and behaviors intended to reduce the effect of calories ingested, such as compulsive exercising or purging by inducing vomiting or taking laxatives. Eating and weight loss habits commonly found in EDs can result in a wide range of energy intake and output, the balance of which leads to a wide range in weight, from extreme loss of weight in AN to fluctuation around a normal to moderately high weight in BN. Reported eating and weight control habits thus inform the initial primary care approach (Table 41.4). Although weight control patterns guide the initial pediatric approach, an assessment of common symptoms and findings on physi- cal examination is essential to identify targets for intervention. When reported symptoms of excessive weight loss (feeling tired and cold; lacking energy; orthostasis; difficulty concentrating) are explicitly linked by the clinician to their associated physical signs (hypothermia with acrocyanosis and slow capillary refill; loss of muscle mass; bra- dycardia with orthostasis), it becomes more difficult for the patient to deny that a problem exists. Furthermore, awareness that bothersome symptoms can be eliminated by healthier eating and activity patterns can increase a patient's motivation to engage in treatment. Tables 41.5 and 41.6 detail common symptoms and signs that should be addressed in a pediatric assessment of a suspected ED. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS In addition to identifying symptoms and signs that deserve targeted intervention for patients who have an ED, a comprehensive history and physical examination are required to rule out other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Weight loss can occur in any condition with increased catabolism (e.g., hyperthyroidism, malignancy, occult chronic infection) or malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease) or in other disorders (Addison disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, stimulant abuse), but these illnesses are generally associated with other findings and are not usually associated with decreased caloric intake. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease can reduce intake to minimize abdomi- nal cramping; eating can cause abdominal discomfort and early satiety in AN because of gastric atony associated with significant weight loss, not malabsorption. Likewise, signs of weight loss in AN might include hypothermia, acrocyanosis with slow capillary refill, and neutropenia similar to some features of sepsis, but the overall picture in EDs is one of relative cardiovascular stability compared with sepsis. Endocrinop- athies are also in the differential of EDs. With BN, voracious appetite in the face of weight loss might suggest diabetes mellitus, but blood glucose levels are normal or low in EDs.

274 Part Ill • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders overactive thyroid, such as hypothermia, bradycardia, and constipa- tion, as well as weight loss and excessive physical activity, respectively. In the CNS, craniopharyngiomas and Rathke pouch tumors can mimic some of the findings of AN, such as weight loss and growth failure, and even some body image disturbances, but the latter are less fixed than in typical EDs and are associated with other findings, including evidence of increased intracranial pressure. Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy, caused by a mutation in the TYMP gene, presents with gastrointestinal dysmotility, cachexia, ptosis, peripheral neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, and leukoencepha- lopathy. Symptoms begin during the second decade of life and are often initially diagnosed as AN. Early satiety, vomiting, cramps, con- stipation, and pseudoobstruction result in weight loss often before the neurologic features are noticed (see Chapter 638.2). Acute or chronic oromotor dysfunction and obsessive-compulsive disorder may mimic an ED. Fear of choking may lead to avoidance-restrictive food intake Any patient with an atypical presentation of an ED, based on age, sex, or other factors not typical for AN or BN, deserves a scrupulous search for an alternative explanation. In ARFID, disturbance in the neurosen- sory processes associated with eating, not weight loss, is the central concern and must be recognized for appropriate treatment. Patients can have both an underlying illness and an ED. The core features of dysfunctional eating habits (body image disturbance and change in weight) can co-occur with conditions such as diabetes mellitus, where patients might manipulate their insulin dosing to lose weight. LABORATORY FINDINGS Because the diagnosis of an ED is made clinically, there is no confir- matory laboratory test. Laboratory abnormalities, when found, are the result of malnutrition secondary to weight control behaviors or medical complications; studies should be chosen based on history and physical examination. A routine screening battery typically includes complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (should be normal), and biochemical profile. Common abnormalities in ED include low white blood cell count with normal hemoglobin and differential; hypokale- mic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis from severe vomiting; mildly elevated liver enzymes, cholesterol, and cortisol levels; low gonado- tropins and blood glucose with marked weight loss; and generally normal total protein, albumin, and renal function. An electrocardio- gram (ECG) may be useful when profound bradycardia or arrhythmia is detected; the ECG usually has low voltage, with nonspecific ST or T-wave changes. Although prolonged QTc has been reported, prospec- tive studies have not found an increased risk for this. Nonetheless, when a prolonged QTc is present in a patient with ED, it may increase the risk for ventricular dysrhythmias. No organ is spared the harmful effects of dysfunctional weight con- trol behaviors, but the most concerning targets of medical complica- tions are the heart, brain, gonads, and bones. Some cardiac findings in EDs (e.g., sinus bradycardia, hypotension) are physiologic adap- tations to starvation that conserve calories and reduce afterload Cold, blue hands and feet with slow capillary refill that can result in tissue perfusion insufficient to meet demands also represent energy-conserving responses associated with inadequate intake. All these acute changes are reversible with restoration of nutri- tion and weight. Significant orthostatic pulse changes, ventricular dysrhythmias, or reduced myocardial contractility reflect myocar- dial impairment that can be lethal. In addition, with extremely low weight, refeeding syndrome (a result of the rapid drop in serum phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium with excessive reintro- duction of calories, specifically carbohydrates), is associated with acute tachycardia and heart failure and neurologic symptoms (see Chapter 63). With long-term malnutrition, the myocardium appears to be more prone to tachyarrhythmias, the second most common cause of death in these patients after suicide. In BN, dysrhythmias can also be related to electrolyte imbalance. Clinically, the primary CNS area affected acutely in EDs, especially with weight loss, is the hypothalamus. Hypothalamic dysfunction is reflected in problems with thermoregulation (warming and cooling), satiety, sleep, autonomic cardioregulatory imbalance (orthostasis), and endocrine function (reduced gonadal and excessive adrenal cor- tex stimulation), all of which are reversible. Anatomic studies of the brain in ED have focused on AN, with the most common finding being increased ventricular and sulcal volumes that normalize with weight restoration. Persistent gray matter deficits following recovery, related to the degree of weight loss, have been reported. Elevated medial tempo- ral lobe cerebral blood flow on positron emission tomography, similar to that found in psychotic patients, suggests that these changes may be related to body image distortion. Also, visualizing high-calorie foods is associated with exaggerated responses in the visual association cortex that are similar to those seen in patients with specific phobias. Patients with AN might have an imbalance between serotonin and dopamine pathways related to neurocircuits in which dietary restraint reduces Reduced gonadal function occurs in male and female patients; it is clinically manifested in AN as amenorrhea in female patients and erectile dysfunction in males. It is related to understimulation from the hypothalamus as well as cortical suppression related to physical and emotional stress. Amenorrhea precedes significant dieting and weight loss in up to 30% of females with AN, and most adolescents with EDs perceive the absence of menses positively. The primary health concern is the negative effect of decreased ovarian function and estrogen on bones. Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) with osteopenia or the more severe osteoporosis is a significant complication of EDs (more pronounced in AN than BN). Data do not support the use of sex hor- mone replacement therapy because this alone does not improve other causes of low BMD (low body weight, lean body mass, low insulin-like growth factor-1, high cortisol). TREATMENT Principles Guiding Primary Care Treatment The approach in primary care should facilitate the acceptance by the ED patient (and parents) of the diagnosis and initial treatment recom- mendations. A nurturant-authoritative approach using the biopsy- chosocial model is useful. A pediatrician who explicitly acknowledges that the patient may disagree with the diagnosis and treatment rec- ommendations and may be ambivalent about changing eating habits, while also acknowledging that recovery requires strength, courage, willpower, and determination, demonstrates nurturance. Parents also find it easier to be nurturing once they learn that the development of an ED is neither a willful decision by the patient nor a reflection of avoids blame or guilt and can prepare the family for professional help that will focus on strengths and restoring health, rather than on the deficits in the adolescent or the family. The authoritative aspect of a physician's role comes from expertise in health, growth, and physical development. A goal of primary care treat- ment should be attaining and maintaining health, not merely weight gain, although weight gain is a means to the goal of wellness. Providers who frame themselves as consultants to the patient with authoritative knowledge about health can avoid a countertherapeutic authoritarian stance. Primary care health-focused activities include monitoring the patient's physical status, setting limits on behaviors that threaten the patient's health, involving specialists with expertise in EDs on the treat- ment team, and continuing to provide primary care for health mainte- nance, acute illness, or injury. The biopsychosocial model uses a broad ecologic framework, starting with the biologic impairments of physical health related to dysfunctional weight control practices, evidenced by symptoms and signs. Explicitly linking ED behaviors to symptoms and signs can increase motivation to change. In addition, there are usually unresolved psychosocial conflicts in both the intrapersonal (self- esteem, self-efficacy) and the interpersonal (family, peers, school) 

domains. Weight control practices initiated as coping mechanisms become reinforced because of positive feedback. That is, external rewards (e.g., compliments about improved physical appearance) and internal rewards (e.g., perceived mastery over what is eaten or what is done to minimize the effects of overeating through exercise productive alternative means of coping must be developed. Nutrition and Physical Activity The primary care provider generally begins the process of prescrib- ing nutrition, although a dietitian should be involved eventually in the meal planning and nutritional education of patients with AN or BN. Framing food as fuel for the body and the source of energy for daily activities emphasizes the health goal of increasing the patient's energy level, endurance, and strength. For patients with AN and low weight, the nutrition prescription should work toward gradually increasing weight at the rate of about 0.5-1 lb/week, by increasing energy intake by 100-200 kcal increments every few days, toward a target of approximately 90% of average body weight for sex, height, and age. Weight gain will not occur until intake exceeds output, and eventual intake for continued weight gain can exceed 4,000 kcal/ day, especially for patients who are anxious and have high levels of thermogenesis from nonexercise activity. Stabilizing intake is the goal for patients with BN, with a gradual introduction of "forbid- den" foods while also limiting foods that might trigger a binge. When initiating treatment of an ED in a primary care setting, the clinician should be aware of common cognitive patterns. Patients with AN typically have all-or-none thinking (related to perfection- ism) with a tendency to overgeneralize and jump to catastrophic conclusions, while assuming that their body is governed by rules that do not apply to others. These tendencies lead to the dichoto- mization of foods into good or bad categories, having a day ruined because of one unexpected event, or choosing foods based on rigid self-imposed restrictions. These thoughts may be related to neu- rocircuitry and neurotransmitter abnormalities associated with executive function and rewards. Weight loss in the absence of body shape, size, or weight concerns should raise suspicion about ARFID, because the emotional distress associated with "forced" eating is not associated with gaining weight, but with the neurosensory experi- ence of eating. A standard nutritional balance of 15-20% calories from protein, 50-55% from carbohydrate, and 25-30% from fat is appropriate. The fat content may need to be lowered to 15-20% early in the treatment of AN because of continued fat phobia. With the risk of low BMD in patients with AN, calcium and vitamin D supplements are often needed to attain the recommended 1,300 mg/day intake of calcium. Refeeding can be accomplished with frequent small meals and snacks consisting of a variety of foods and beverages (with minimal diet or fat-free products), rather than fewer high-volume high-calorie meals. Some patients find it easier to take in part of the additional nutrition as canned supplements (medicine) rather than food. Regardless of the source of energy intake, the risk for refeeding syndrome (e.g., see the previous section on "Complica- tions") increases with the degree of weight loss and the rapidity of caloric increases (see Chapter 63). Therefore, if the weight has fallen below 80% of expected weight for height, refeeding should proceed carefully (not necessarily slowly) and possibly in the hos- pital (Table 41.7). Patients with AN tend to have a highly structured day with restrictive intake, in contrast to BN, which is characterized by a lack of structure, resulting in chaotic eating patterns and binge-purge episodes. All patients with AN, BN, or ED-NOS benefit from a daily structure for healthy eating that includes three meals and at least one snack a day, distributed evenly over the day, based on balanced meal planning. Breakfast deserves special emphasis because it is often the Chapter 41 • Eating Disorders 275 Table 41.7 Potential Indications for Inpatient Medical Hospitalization of Patients with Anorexia Nervosa PHYSICAL AND LABORATORY Heart rate <50 beats/min Other cardiac rhythm disturbances Blood pressure <80/50 mm Hg Postural hypotension resulting in >10 mm Hg decrease or >25 beats/ min increase Hypokalemia Hypophosphatemia Hypoglycemia Dehydration Body temperature <36.1°C (97°F) <80% healthy body weight Hepatic, cardiac, or renal compromise PSYCHIATRIC Suicidal intent and plan Very poor motivation to recover (in family and patient) Preoccupation with ego-syntonic thoughts Coexisting psychiatric disorders MISCELLANEOUS Requires supervision after meals and while using the restroom Failed day treatment first meal eliminated in AN and is often avoided the morning after a binge-purge episode in BN. In addition to structuring meals and snacks, patients should plan structure in their activities. Although overexercising is common in AN, completely prohibiting exercise can lead to further restriction of intake or to surreptitious exercise; inactivity should be limited to situations in which weight loss is dra- matic or there is physiologic instability. Also, healthy exercise (once a day, for no more than 30 min, at no more than moderate intensity) can improve mood and make increasing calories more acceptable. Because patients with AN often are unaware of their level of activity and tend toward progressively increasing their output, exercising without either a partner or supervision is not recommended. Primary Care Treatment Follow-up primary care visits are essential in the management of EDs. Close monitoring of the response of the patient and the family to suggested interventions is required to determine which patients can remain in primary care treatment (patients with early, mildly disordered eating), which patients need to be referred to individ- ual specialists for co-management (mildly progressive disordered eating), and which patients need to be referred for interdisciplin- ary team management (EDs). Between the initial and subsequent visits, the patient can record daily caloric intake (food, drink, amount, time, location), physical activity (type, duration, inten- sity), and emotional state (e.g., angry, sad, worried) in a journal that is reviewed jointly with the patient in follow-up. Focusing on the recorded data helps the clinician to identify dietary and activity deficiencies and excesses, as well as behavioral and mental health patterns, and helps the patient to become objectively aware of the relevant issues to address in recovery. Given the tendency of patients with AN to overestimate their caloric intake and underestimate their activity level, before reviewing the journal record it is important at each visit to measure weight, with- out underwear, in a hospital gown after voiding; urine specific grav- ity; temperature; and blood pressure and pulse in supine, sitting, and standing positions as objective data. In addition, a targeted physical examination focused on hypometabolism, cardiovascular stability, and mental status, as well as any related symptoms, should occur at each visit to monitor progress (or regression). 

276 Part Ill • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders Referral to Mental Health Services In addition to referral to a registered dietitian, mental health and other services are important elements of treatment of ED patients. Depend- ing on availability and experience, these services can be provided by a psychiatric social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist, who should team with the primary care provider. ARFID presents the challenge of working with patients' negative experiences of eating, or fear of trauma such as vomiting or choking, while also addressing inadequate nutritional needs. Although patients with AN often are prescribed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) because of depressive symptoms, there is no evidence of efficacy for patients at low weight; food remains the initial treatment of choice to treat depression in AN. SSRIs, very effective in reducing binge-purge behaviors regardless of depression, are considered a standard element of therapy in BN. SSRI dosage in BN, however, may need to increase to an equivalent of >60 mg of fluoxetine to maintain effectiveness. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, which focuses on restructuring "thinking errors" and establishing adaptive patterns of behavior, is more effective than interpersonal or psychoanalytic approaches in ED patients. Dialectical behavioral therapy, in which distorted thoughts and emotional responses are challenged, analyzed, and replaced with healthier ones, with an emphasis on "mindfulness"" requires adult thinking skills and is useful for older patients with BN. Group ther- apy can provide much needed support, but it requires a skilled clini- cian. Combining patients at various levels of recovery who experience variable reinforcement from dysfunctional coping behaviors can be challenging if group therapy patients compete with each other to be "thinner" or take up new behaviors such as vomiting. The younger the patient, the more intimately the parents need to be involved in therapy. The only treatment approach with evidence- based effectiveness in the treatment of AN in children and adolescents is family-based treatment, exemplified by the Maudsley approach This three-phase intensive outpatient model helps parents play a posi- tive role in restoring their child's eating and weight to normal, then returns control of eating to the child, who has demonstrated the ability to maintain healthy weight, and then encourages healthy progression in the other domains of adolescent development. Features of effective family treatment include (1) an agnostic approach in which the cause of the disease is unknown and irrelevant to weight gain, emphasizing that parents are not to blame for EDs; (2) parents being actively nurtur- ing and supportive of their child's healthy eating while reinforcing lim- its on dysfunctional habits, rather than an authoritarian "food police" or complete hands-off approach; and (3) reinforcement of parents as the best resource for recovery for almost all patients, with professionals serving as consultants and advisors to help parents address challenges. Referral to an Interdisciplinary Eating Disorder Team The treatment of a child or adolescent diagnosed with an ED is ideally provided by an interdisciplinary team (physician, nurse, dietitian, men- tal health provider) with expertise treating pediatric patients. Because such teams, often led by specialists in adolescent medicine at medical centers, are not widely available, the primary care provider might need to convene such a team. Adolescent medicine-based programs report encouraging treatment outcomes, possibly related to patients entering earlier into care and the stigma that some patients and parents may associate with psychiatry-based programs. Specialty centers focused on treating EDs are generally based in psychiatry and often have separate tracks for younger and adult patients. The elements of treatment noted earlier (cognitive-behavioral, dialectical behavioral, family-based), as well as individual and group treatment, should all be available as part of interdisciplinary team treatment. Comprehensive services ide- ally include intensive outpatient and partial hospitalization as well as inpatient treatment. Regardless of the intensity, type, or location of the treatment services, the patient, parents, and primary care provider are essential members of the treatment team. A recurring theme in effec- tive treatment is helping patients and families reestablish connections that are disrupted by the ED. Inpatient medical treatment of EDs is generally limited to patients with AN to stabilize and treat life-threatening starvation and to pro- vide supportive mental health services. Inpatient medical care may be required to avoid refeeding syndrome in severely malnourished patients, provide nasogastric tube feeding for patients unable or unwilling to eat, or initiate mental health services, especially family- based treatment, if this has not occurred on an outpatient basis (see Table 41.7). Admission to a general pediatric unit is advised only for short-term stabilization in preparation for transfer to a medical unit with expertise in treating pediatric EDs. Inpatient psychiatric care of EDs should be provided on a unit with expertise in managing often challenging behaviors (e.g., hiding or discarding food, vomiting, sur- reptitious exercise) and emotional problems (e.g., depression, anxiety). Suicidal risk is small, but patients with AN might threaten suicide if made to eat or gain weight in an effort to "get their parents to back off." An ED partial hospital program offers outpatient services that are less intensive than round-the-clock inpatient care. Generally held 4-5 days/week for 6 to 9 hours each session, partial hospital program ser- vices typically are group based and include eating at least two meals as well as opportunities to address issues in a setting that more closely approximates "real life" than inpatient treatment. That is, patients sleep at home and are free-living on weekends, exposing them to challenges that can be processed during the 25-40 hours each week in program, as well as sharing group and family experiences. Supportive Care In relation to pediatric EDs, support groups are primarily designed for parents. Because their daughter or son with an ED often resists the diagnosis and treatment, parents often feel helpless and hopeless. Because of the historical precedent of blaming parents for causing EDs, parents often express feelings of shame and isolation (www.maudsley parents.org). Support groups and multifamily therapy sessions bring parents together with other parents whose families are at various stages of recovery from an El in ways that are educational and encouraging Patients often beneht from support groups after intensive treatment or at the end of treatment because of residual body image or other issues after eating and weight have normalized. PROGNOSIS With early diagnosis and effective treatment, ≥80% of youth with AN recover: They develop normal eating and weight control habits, resume menses, maintain average weight for height, and function in school, work, and relationships, although some still have poor body image. With weight restoration, fertility returns as well, although the weight for resumption of menses (approximately 92% of average body weight for height) may be lower than the weight for ovulation. The prognosis for BN is less well established, but outcome improves with multidimensional treatment that includes SSRIs and attention to mood, past trauma, impulsivity, and any existing psychopathol- ogy. Since the diagnosis of ARFID was only established in 2013, little is known about its long-term prognosis, although anecdotal evidence suggests that weight restoration is not actively resisted as PREVENTION Given the complexity of the pathogenesis of EDs, prevention is diffi- cult. Targeted preventive interventions can reduce risk factors in older adolescents and college-age women. Universal prevention efforts to promote healthy weight regulation and discourage unhealthy dieting have not shown effectiveness in middle school students. Programs that include recovered patients or focus on the problems associated with EDs can inadvertently normalize or even glamorize EDs and should be discouraged.

Chapter 42 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders Erica H. Lee, Keneisha R. Sinclair-McBride, David R. DeMaso, and Heather J. Walter The disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders (CDs) are interrelated sets of psychiatric symptoms characterized by a core deficit in self-regulation of anger, aggression, dehance, and antisocial behav- iors that typically begin in childhood or adolescence. These disorders include oppositional defiant, intermittent explosive, conduct, and other specified/unspecified disruptive/impulse-control/CDs, as well as pyro- mania, kleptomania, and antisocial personality disorder. Although all involve difhculty with both emotional and behavioral self-regulation, the disorders vary by the relative intensity of problems with emotional regulation (e.g., anger outbursts) vs behavioral regulation (e.g., defi- ance, aggression, violating the rights of others or societal norms). DESCRIPTION Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is characterized by a persistent pattern lasting at least 6 months of angry/irritable mood, argumenta- tive/defiant behavior, and/or vindictiveness exhibited during interac- tion with at least one individual who is not a sibling (Table 42.1). For preschool children, the behavior must occur on most days, whereas in school-age children, the behavior must occur at least once a week. The severity of the disorder is considered mild if symptoms are confined to only one setting (e.g., at home, at school, at work, with peers), moderate if symptoms are present in at least two settings, and severe if symptoms are present in three or more settings. Intermittent explosive disorder (IED) is characterized by recur- rent verbal or physical aggression that is grossly disproportionate to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial stressors (Table 42.2). The outbursts, which are impulsive and/or anger-based rather than premeditated and/or instrumental, typically onset rap- idly, last <30 minutes, and frequently occur in response to a minor provocation by a close intimate. CD is characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern over at least 12 months of serious aggressive, destructive, and/or rule- violating behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age- appropriate societal norms or rules are violated (Table 42.3). The symptoms of CD are divided into four major categories: aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, and serious rule violations (e.g., truancy, running away). Three sub- types of CD (which have different prognostic significance) are based on the age of onset: childhood-onset type, adolescent-onset type, and unspecified. A small proportion of individuals with CD exhibit char- acteristics (lack of remorse/guilt, callous/lack of empathy, uncon- cerned about performance, shallow/deficient affect) that qualify for the "with limited prosocial emotions" specifier. CD is classified as mild when few if any symptoms over those required for the diagnosis are present, and the symptoms cause relatively minor harm to oth- ers. CD is classified as severe if many symptoms over those required for the diagnosis are present, and the symptoms cause considerable harm to others. Moderate severity is intermediate between mild and specified/unspecified disruptive/impulse-control/CD (subsyndromal disorder) applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of the disorders in this class are present and cause clini- cally significant distress or functional impairment, but do not meet full diagnostic criteria for any of the disorders in this class. Chapter 42 • Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders 277 EPIDEMIOLOGY The prevalence of ODD is approximately 3%, and in preadolescents is more common in males than females (1.4:1). One-year prevalence rates for IED and CD approximate 3% and 4%, respectively. For CD, prevalence rates rise from childhood to adolescence and are higher among males than females. CLINICAL COURSE Oppositional behavior can occur in all children and adolescents at times, particularly during the toddler and early teenage periods when autonomy and independence are normative developmental tasks. Oppositional behavior becomes a concern when it is frequent, intense, persistent, and pervasive and when it affects the child's social, family, and/or academic life. Some of the earliest manifestations of opposition- ality are stubbornness (3 years), defiance and temper tantrums (4-5 years), and argumentativeness (6 years). Approximately 65% of chil- dren with ODD exit from the diagnosis after a 3-year follow-up; ear- lier age at onset of oppositional symptoms conveys a poorer prognosis. ODD often precedes the development of CD and there is an approxi- mately 30% higher likelihood of CD when ODD is comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ODD also increases the risk for the development of depressive and anxiety disorders. The defiant, argumentative, and vindictive symptoms carry most of the risk for CD, whereas the angry, irritable mood symptoms carry most of the risk for depression and anxiety. IED usually begins in late childhood or adolescence and appears to follow a persistent course over many years, with recurrent periods of impulsive and aggressive outbursts. The onset of CD may occur as early as the preschool years, but the first significant symptoms usually emerge during the period from middle childhood through middle adolescence; onset is rare after age 16 years. Symptoms of CD vary with age as the individual develops increased physical strength, cognitive abilities, and sexual maturity. Symptoms that emerge first tend to be less serious (e.g., lying), while those emerging later tend to be more severe (e.g., sexual or physical assault). Severe behaviors emerging at an early age convey a poor prog- nosis. In the majority of individuals, the disorder remits by adulthood: in a substantial fraction, antisocial personality disorder develops. Indi- viduals with CD also are at risk for the later development of mood, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, impulse-control, psychotic, somatic symptom, and substance-related disorders. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The disorders in this diagnostic class share a number of characteristics with each other as well as with disorders from other classes, and as such must be carefully differentiated. ODD can be distinguished from CD by the absence of physical aggression and destructiveness and by the presence of angry, irritable mood. ODD can be distinguished from IED by the lack of serious aggression toward others (e.g., physical assault). IED can be distinguished from CD by the lack of predatory aggression and other, nonaggressive symptoms of CD. The oppositionality seen in ODD, the explosivity seen in IED, and the aggression/destructiveness seen in Cl must be distinguished from those symptoms occurring in the context of other psychiatric disor- ders, particularly ADHD, depression, and bipolar, substance-related, autism spectrum, or psychotic disorders. COMORBIDITY Rates of ODD are much higher in children with ADHD, which suggests shared temperamental risk factors. Depressive, anxiety, and substance- related disorders are most often comorbid with IED. ADHD and ODD are both common in individuals with CD, and this comorbid presenta- tion predicts worse outcomes. CD may also occur with anxiety, depres- sive, bipolar, learning, language, and substance-related disorders. SEQUELAE The disruptive, impulse-control, and CDs are associated with a wide range of psychiatric disorders in adulthood and with many other adverse outcomes, such as suicidal behavior, physical injury, 

278 Part III • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders Table 42.1 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder A. A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 mo as evidenced by at least four symptoms from any of the following categories, and exhibited during interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling: ANGRY/IRRITABLE MOOD 1. Often loses temper. 2. Is often touchy or easily annoyed. 3. Is often angry and resentful. ARGUMENTATIVE/DEFIANT BEHAVIOR 4. Often argues with authority figures or, for children and adolescents, with adults. 5. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from authority figures or with rules. 6. Often deliberately annoys others. 7. Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior. VINDICTIVENESS 8. Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6 mo. Note: The persistence and frequency of these behaviors should be used to distinguish a behavior that is within normal limits from a behavior that is symptomatic. For children younger than 5 yr, the behavior should occur on most days for a period of at least 6 mo unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For individuals 5 yr or older, the behavior should occur at least once per week for at least 6 mo, unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). Although these frequency criteria provide guidance on a minimal level of frequency to define symptoms, other factors should be considered, such as whether the frequency and intensity of the behaviors are outside a range that is normative for the individual's developmental level, gender, B. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the individual or others in his or her immediate social context (e.g., family, peer group, work colleagues), or it impacts negatively on social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. C. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic, substance use, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also, the criteria are not met for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

American Psychiatric Association. delinquency and criminality, legal problems, substance use, unplanned pregnancy, social instability, marital failure, and academic and occupa- tional underachievement. ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS At the individual level, a number of neurobiologic markers (lower heart rate and skin conductance reactivity, reduced basal cortisol reactivity, abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, serotonergic abnor- malities) have been variously associated with aggressive behavior disor- ders. Other biologic risk factors include pre-, peri-, and postnatal insults; cognitive and linguistic impairment, particularly language-based learning deficits; difficult temperamental characteristics, particularly negative affec- tivity, emotional reactivity, poor frustration tolerance, and impulsivity; cer- tain personality characteristics (novelty seeking, reduced harm avoidance, and reward dependence); and certain cognitive characteristics (cognitive rigidity, hostile attributions for ambiguous social cues). At the family level, a consistently demonstrated risk factor is ineffective parenting. Parents of behaviorally disordered children are more inconsis- tent in their use of rules, issue more and unclear commands, are more likely to respond to their child based on their own mood rather than the child's behavior, are more likely to utilize a harsh or neglectful parenting style, are less likely to monitor their children's whereabouts, and are relatively unre- sponsive to their children's prosocial behavior. Complicating this asso- ciation is the consistent finding that temperamentally difficult children Table 42.2 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Intermittent Explosive Disorder A. Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses as manifested by either of the following: 1. Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights) or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 mo. The physical aggression does not result in damage or destruction of property and does not result in physical injury to animals or other individuals. Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of property and/or physical assault involving physical injury against animals or other individuals occurring with a 12 mo period. B. The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent outbursts is grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial stressors. C. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e., they are impulsive and/or anger-based) and are not committed to achieve some tangible objective (e.g., money, power, intimidation). D. The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress in the individual or impairment in occupational or interpersonal functioning, or as associated with financial or legal consequences. E. Chronologic age is at least 6 yr (or equivalent developmental level). F. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a psychotic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder) and are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., head trauma, Alzheimer disease) or to the physiologic effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication). For children ages 6-18 yr, aggressive behavior that occurs as part of an adjustment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis. Note: This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder when recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts are in excess of those usually seen in these disorders and warrant clinical attention. From the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. p. 466. Copyright 2013. American Psychiatric Association. are more likely to elicit negative parenting responses, including physical punishment, which can exacerbate anger and oppositionality in the child. Other important family-level influences include impaired parent-child attachment, child maltreatment (physical and sexual abuse, neglect), expo- sure to marital conflict and domestic violence, family poverty and crime, frequent changes in caregivers, and family genetic liability (family history of the disorders in this class along with substance use, depressive, bipolar, schizophrenic, somatization, and personality disorders, as well as ADHD, have all been shown to be associated with the development of behavior disorders). Peer-level influence on the development of behavior problems includes peer rejection in childhood and antisocial peer groups. Neighborhood influences include social processes such as collective efficacy, social con- trol, and exposure to violence. Culturally, it is helpful to consider the context in which undesirable behaviors occur to better understand their function. PREVENTION An effective conduct problem prevention program was Fast Track, a multicomponent school-based intervention comprising a classroom curriculum targeted at conflict resolution and interpersonal skills, parent training, and interventions targeted at the school environment. Imple- mented in grades 1 through 10, former program participants at age 25 had a lower prevalence of any externalizing, internalizing, or substance 

Table 42.3 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Conduct Disorder A. A repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated, as manifested by the presence of at least 3 of the following 15 criteria in the past 12 mo from any of the following categories, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 mo: AGGRESSION TO PEOPLE AND ANIMALS 1. Often bullies, threatens, or intimidates others. 2. Often initiates physical fights. 3. Has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others (e.g., a bat, brick, broken bottle, knite, gun). Has been physically cruel to people. Has been physically cruel to animals. 6. Has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching, extortion, armed robbery). 7. Has forced someone into sexual activity. DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY 8. Has deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage. 9. Has deliberately destroyed others' property (other than by fire setting). DECEITFULNESS OR THEFT 10. Has broken into someone else's house, building, or car. 11. Often lies to obtain good or favors or to avoid obligations (i.e., "cons" others). 12. Has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a victim (e.g., shoplifting, but without breaking and entering; forgery). SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF RULES 13. Often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions, beginning before age 13 yr. 14. Has run away from home overnight at least twice while living in the parental or parental surrogate home, or once without returning for a lengthy period. 15. Is often truant from school, beginning before age 13 yr. B. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. C. If the individual is age 18 yr or older, criteria are not met for antisocial personality disorder. From the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. pp. 469-471. Copyright 2013. American Psychiatric Association. abuse problem than program nonparticipants. Program participants also had lower violent and drug crime conviction scores, lower risky sexual behavior scores, and higher well-being scores. Another useful prevention program, the Seattle Social Development Project, was also a multicompo- nent school-based intervention with teacher, parent, and student compo- nents targeting classroom management, interpersonal problem solving, child behavior management, and academic support skills. Implemented in grades 1 through 6, outcomes at age 19 years demonstrated that the intervention decreased lifetime drug use and delinquency for participant males compared with males in comparator communities but had no sig- nificant effects on females. SCREENING/CASE FINDING The parents of children presenting in the primary care setting should be queried about angry mood or aggressive, defiant, or antisocial behavior as part of the routine clinical interview. A typical screen- ing question would be, "Does (name] have a lot of trouble controlling [his/her] anger or behavior?" A number of standardized broad-band screening instruments widely used in the primary care setting (e.g., Pediatric Symptom Checklist, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) have items specific to angry mood and aggressive behavior, and as such can also be used to identify problems in this domain. Chapter 42 • Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders 279 EARLY INTERVENTION Youth (and/or their parents) presenting in the primary care setting who self-report or respond affirmatively to queries about difficulties manag- ing angry mood or aggressive or antisocial behavior should be afforded the opportunity to talk about the situation with the pediatric practitio- ner (separately with older youth as indicated). By engaging in active listening (e.g., "I hear how you have been feeling. Tell me more about what happened to make you feel that way"), the pediatric practitioner can establish therapeutic rapport and begin to assess the onset, duration, context, severity, and complexity of the symptoms, and associated dan- gerousness, distress, and functional impairment. In the absence of acute dangerousness (e.g., homicidality, assaultiveness, psychosis, substance abuse) and significant distress or functional impairment, the pediatric practitioner can schedule a follow-up appointment within a few weeks to conduct a behavior assessment. At this follow-up visit, to assist with decision-making about appropriate level of care, a focused symptom rating scale can be administered (Table 42.4) and additional risk factors explored (e.g., see the previous section on "Etiology and Risk Factors"). For mild symptoms (manageable by the parent and not function- ally impairing) and in the absence of major risk factors, guided self-help (anticipatory guidance) and monitoring with a scheduled follow-up may suffice. Guided self-help can include provision of educational materials (pamphlets, books, videos, workbooks, internet sites) that provide infor- mation to the youth about dealing with anger-provoking situations, and advice to parents about strengthening the parent-child relationship, effec- tive parenting strategies, and the effects of adverse environmental expo- sures on the development of behavior problems. In a Cochrane review, media-based parenting interventions had a moderate positive effect on child behavior problems, either alone or as an adjunct to medication. An example of a self-help program for parents is the Positive Parenting Pro- gram (Triple P; http://www.triplep-parenting.com), online version, in which parents can purchase 6-8 modules of instruction addressing tech- niques for positive parenting and strategies for encouraging good behavior, teaching new emotional and behavioral skills, and managing misbehavior with youth from toddlers to teens (see Chapter 20). If a mental health clinician has been co-located or integrated into the primary care setting, all parents of young children (universal prevention), as well as the parents of youth with mild behavior problems (indicated prevention), could be provided with a brief version of behavioral parent training. For example, Incredible Years (http://www.incredibleyears.com) has a 4-8 session universal prevention version to help parents promote their 2-6-year-old children's emotional regulation, social competence, problem solving, and reading readiness. A randomized trial in pediatric practices found that Incredible Years significantly improved parenting practices and 2-4-year-olds' disruptive behaviors compared to a wait-list control. Incredible Years' positive effects on parenting and child behavior have been found for populations diverse in race, cultural background, and socioeconomic status. Similarly, the Triple P program has seminar (three, 90 minute sessions), brief (15-30 min consultations), and primary care (four, 20-30 minute consultations) versions for the parents of youth from birth to the teenage years, specifically designed for implementation in the primary care setting. The Triple P interventions, supported by an extensive evidence base, focus on strengthening the parent-child relation- ship, identifying and monitoring the frequency of a problem behavior, and implementing and reviewing the effects of a targeted behavior plan. Meta- analyses have found that gains from Triple P are maintained over time. TREATMENT For youth who continue to have mild to moderate behavior problems after several weeks of guided self-help or a brief course of behavioral parent training, or who from the outset exhibit moderate to severe symptoms, or who have a history of maltreatment or severe family dysfunction or psy- chopathology, assessment and treatment in the specialty mental health set- ting by a child-trained mental health clinician should be provided. The youth's problem behavior may predominantly occur at home, at school, with peers, or in the community, or it may be pervasive. If possible, interventions need to address each context specifically, rather than assum- ing generalizability of treatment. Thus, for behaviors mostly manifested in the home setting, behavioral parent training would be the treatment of

School-based services can include a functional behavioral analysis to determine the function of the problematic behavior for the child, and development of a behavioral intervention plan to direct the child toward alternative positive behaviors that can achieve the same goal. School-based services should be considered whenever a child is subjected to repeated disciplinary action in school or suspensions for misbehavior. When there are pervasive problems, including aggression toward peers, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with the child/teen can be employed in addition to the other interventions. Behavioral parent training has been extensively studied for the treat- ment of youth problem behavior. These programs work by reshaping nega- tive family patterns that may trigger or reinforce problem behaviors. They are typically 10-15 weeks in duration and focus on some combination of the following components: understanding social learning principles, developing a warm supportive relationship with the child, encouraging child-directed interaction and play, providing a predictable structured household environment, setting clear and simple household rules, con- sistently praising and materially or socially rewarding positive behavior, consistently ignoring annoying behavior (followed by praise when the annoying behavior ceases), giving effective commands, and consistently giving consequences (e.g., time-out, loss of privileges) for dangerous or destructive behavior. Other important targets for parenting training include understanding developmentally appropriate moods and behav- jor, managing difficult temperamental characteristics, fostering the child's social and emotional development, and protecting the child from trau- matic exposures. Parent training can be implemented with families in individual or group formats. Specific parent training programs include Incredible Years and Triple P, described earlier, and Parent-Child Interac- tion Therapy, Helping the Noncompliant Child, and Parent Management Training Oregon. Predictors of nonresponse to these interventions have included greater initial symptom severity as well as involvement of the parent with child protection services. Difficulty with adherence to the complete treatment regimen has lim- ited the effectiveness of parent training programs. Estimates of premature termination are as high as 50-60%, and termination within five treatment sessions is not uncommon. Predictors of premature termination have included single-parent status, low family income, low parental education levels, young maternal age, minority group status, and life stresses. CBT for youth with disruptive behavior also has been extensively stud- ied. Common CBT techniques for disruptive behavior include identifying the antecedents and consequences of disruptive or aggressive behavior, learning strategies for recognizing and regulating anger expression, problem-solving and cognitive restructuring (perspective-taking) tech- niques, and modeling and rehearsing socially appropriate behaviors that could replace angry or aggressive reactions. Programs typically are deliv- ered in 16-20 weekly sessions. Multicomponent treatments for serious behavior disorders such as CD target the broader social context. Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care, delivered in a foster care setting for 6-9 months, typically includes foster parent training and support; family therapy for biologic parents; youth anger management, social skills, and problem-solving train- ing; school-based behavioral interventions and academic support; and AGE RANGE (YR) 5-18 2-16 12-17 2-16 6-12 NO.

Due to the strength of the supporting evidence, these multicomponent programs have been designated "well- established" treatments for adolescents involved in the juvenile justice system. Predictors of nonresponse to multicomponent treatments have included higher frequency of rule-breaking behavior and predatory aggression, higher psychopathy scores, and comorbid mood disorders. Psychosocial interventions should be considered the first-line inter- vention; pharmacotherapy may provide benefit, particularly if psycho- social treatment has not led to adequate improvement. Three classes of medication, stimulants, az-adrenergic agonists, and atypical antipsy- chotics, have evidence for the management of impulsive, anger-driven aggressive behavior, although none is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication, except irritability/ aggression in autism. Resource limitations may necessitate provision of pharmacotherapy in the primary care setting; the safety and efficacy of this practice can be enhanced by regular consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist or developmental-behavioral pediatrician. There are favorable effects of stimulants on oppositional behavior, anger outbursts, and aggression in youths, with or without comorbid ADHD. The doses of stimulants used for aggression are similar to those used for ADHD. An extended-release Cz-adrenergic agonist (guanfacine) is effica- cious for oppositionality comorbid with ADHD, with a dose of 1-4 mg/ day, dosed according to weight. There is evidence for efficacy of risperi- done in reducing aggression and conduct problems in children age 5-18 years. The suggested usual daily dose of risperidone for severe aggression is 1.5-2 mg for children and 2-4 mg for adolescents, titrating up as needed and tolerated from starting doses of 0.25 mg (children) or 0.5 mg (adoles- cents). The use of this class of medication should be reserved for severe presentations in which the safety of self and/or others is compromised. Medication trials should be systematic, and the duration of trials should be sufficient (generally 6-8 weeks for atypical antipsychotics; shorter for stimulants and a-agonists) to determine the agent's effectiveness. The short-term goal of medication treatment is to achieve at least a 50% reduc- tion in aggressive symptoms, as assessed by a focused symptom rating scale (see Table 42.4); the ultimate goal is to achieve symptom remission (below clinical cutpoint on the rating scale). A second medication of the same class can be considered if there is insufficient evidence of response to the maximal tolerated dose. Care should be taken to avoid unnecessary polypharmacy, in part by discontinuing agents that have not demonstrated signincant beneht. Discontinuation of the medication should be consid- ered after a symptom-free interval. LEVEL OF CARE Most children and adolescents with a behavior disorder can be safely and effectively treated in the outpatient setting. Youths with intractable CD may benefit from residential or specialized foster care treatment, where more intensive treatments can be provided.

Chapter 43 Tantrums and Breath- Holding Spells Keneisha R. Sinclair-McBride, Erica H. Lee, David R. DeMaso, and Heather J. Walter Temper tantrums are common during early childhood. They are typically developmentally normative expressions of children's frus- tration with their own limitations or anger about not being able to get their way. It is important for parents to recognize the different trig- gers for tantrums to determine the best course of action to prevent or manage this behavior as it arises. Dealing with tantrum behavior can become very frustrating for parents and these feelings should be validated, while also helping make sure parents are aware that many tantrums can be averted by awareness or attunement to certain cues given by their child. In particular, parents should be aware that when a child is tired, hungry, or has to make a transition, it can be expected that the child will be more likely to have a tantrum because limit setting or unmet expectations may feel particularly overwhelming in these circumstances. In this case, it is advised that parents plan ahead and take a preventive stance by being aware of triggers and minimizing the potential for a tantrum. Parents should not make a tired or hungry child accompany them on an extended outing unless absolutely necessary. Additionally, depending on the child's devel- opmental level, it is helpful to have a clear discussion ahead of time about the expectations in certain scenarios. An example of setting expectations to help prevent a tantrum is: "When we go into the store I need you to (1) stay with me, (2) keep your hands to yourself, and (3) not whine for treats. If you can do these three things, we can bick one treat to bring home." When children are able to demonstrate good control, their behavior should be acknowledged, praised, and rewarded when appropriate. This will increase the likelihood that they will engage in the desired response more often, even in situa- tions they find frustrating. When children tantrum as an expression of anger or sadness in not getting their way, parents may feel inclined to give in or respond to the negative behavior with yelling or threats. Unfortunately, these responses can reinforce and even escalate the oppositional behavior. Parents should attempt to avert defiance by giving the child choices (e.g., you can walk to the car on your own two feet or I can carry you). Active ignoring can be used for mild tantrum behaviors because pay- ing attention, even negative attention, can be reinforcing. If a child is tantruming in a way that is unsafe, they can be removed from the unsafe situation and given a consequence by being placed in time-out. If the tantrum was to avoid a task, the child should be required to com- plete the task once time-out is over. Breath-holding spells occasionally occur during a tantrum and can befriening pater pa. The cranefer may ente cowshich the crying occasionally will have a brief seizure. Parents are best advised to ignore Chapter 43 • Tantrums and Breath-Holding Spells 281 breath holding during a tantrum once it has started. Without reinforce- ment, breath-holding generally disappears. Subtypes of breath-holding spells include cyanotic, pallid, or mixed episodes. Cyanotic spells are the dominant type. Pallid spells may be similar to vasovagal-related syncopal events in older children and may be initiated by similar stimuli. Iron deficiency with or without anemia may be present, and some children with breath-holding spells respond to iron therapy. There is no increased risk of seizure disorders in children who have had a short seizure during a breath-holding spell. Medical conditions to rule-out in breath-holding spells (usually pallid) include seizures, Chiari crisis, familial dysautonomia, cardiac arrhyth- mias, cataplexy, hereditary hyperekplexia, and other central nervous system lesions. The first key to the management of temper tantrums and breath- holding spells is to help parents intervene before the child is highly distressed. The parent can be instructed to calmly remind the child of the expected behavior and the potential consequence if the expected behavior does not occur. In addition, distraction to another activity or conversation may help. If the child does not comply, he or she should be placed in time-out for a period approximating 1 min for each year of age. Parents should state the reason the child is being placed in time- out beforehand in a calm and neutral tone, but they should not discuss the reasons during time-out. Once the time-out is over and the child is calm, it may be helpful for parents to discuss with the child the reasons for the child's frustration and their expectations for how the child will respond in the future. Time-out can be effectively used in children up to approximately 10 years of age. Parents should also be advised to be mindful of their own reactions to their child's tantrum behavior to avoid an escalation of the child's behavior caused by an angry parental response. If behavioral measures such as time-out fail, pediatricians must assess other aspects of parent-child interactions, such as the frequency of positive interactions, the consistency of parental responses to child behavior, and the ways that parents handle anger, before making fur- ther recommendations. In the absence of frequent positive parent- child interactions, time-out may not be effective, and inconsistent responding to problem behavior increases the likelihood of the nega- tive behavior continuing. Children can be frightened by the intensity of their own angry feelings and by angry feelings they arouse in their par- ents. Parents should model the anger control that they want their chil- dren to exhibit. Some parents are unable to see that if they lose control themselves, their own angry behavior does not help their children to behave differently. Advising parents to calmly provide simple choices will help the child to feel more in control and to develop a sense of autonomy. Providing the child with options also typically helps reduce the child's feelings of anger and shame, which can later have adverse effects on social and emotional development. Providing choice also reduces power struggles between the parent and child and can aid in enhancing the parent-child relationship and building problem-solving When tantrum behavior, including breath holding, does not respond to parent coaching or is accompanied by head banging or high levels of aggression, referral for a mental health evaluation is indicated. Further evaluation is also recommended if tantrum behavior persists into the latency period and preteen years. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. 

282 Part Ill • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders Chapter 44 Lying, Stealing, and Truancy Keneisha R. Sinclair-McBride, Erica H. Lee, David R. DeMaso, and Heather J. Walter Young children lie for a multitude of reasons. Lies for this age group can be considered developmentally normative attempts at understanding lan- guage, communication, rules, and expectations. In early childhood, lying often occurs as a child experiments with language. By observing the reac- tions of parents, preschoolers learn about expectations for honesty in com- munication. Lying can also be a form of fantasy for children, who often describe things as they wish them to be rather than as they are. To avoid an unpleasant confrontation, a child who has not followed a rule or met an expectation may lie. At this stage, children often do not understand that lying only postpones a confrontation. Parents should keep in mind that lying behavior in this age group is rarely malicious or premeditated. In older children, lying is generally an effort to cover up actions that do not fit into the child's conceptualization of themselves. Children in this age group may lie as an attempt to maintain self-esteem. Of course, lying is also often used to avoid a negative consequence for misbehavior. Older children are also more likely to intentionally leave out critical parts of a story in an attempt to deceive or avoid a negative consequence. Lying can also be promoted by poor adult modeling. Many children and adoles- cents lie to avoid adults' disapproval. If children and teens are responded to in harsh and punitive ways, they may lie to avoid this. Alternatively, lying may be used as a method of rebellion, especially in adolescence. Lying about forbidden activities, social media use, or other behaviors may be an attempt to continue to break the rules without detection. Chronic lying can occur in combination with several other antisocial behaviors and is a sign of underlying psychopathology or family dysfunction. Parents should address lying by giving the child a clear message of what is acceptable. Sensitivity and support combined with limit setting are nec- essary for a successful intervention. Although habitual lying can become frustrating for parents, they should be discouraged from making accusa- tions or focusing on catching their child in a lie and instead should work toward creating an atmosphere that makes it easier for their child to tell the truth. Parents should let the child know that telling the truth about a dif- ficult situation will allow the parents to help them better problem-solve the issue at hand. Should a situation arise where a child has lied and the parents are aware of the true details, the lie should be confronted while providing the facts of what is known and also stating the desired or expected behav- ior. This should be done in a calm, neutral manner. For example, if a parent is aware that a child played video games instead of doing homework and the child denies it, the parent can state, "I notice that your homework is incomplete and that you are playing without permission. Our rule is that you complete homework first. There will be no more video games for the rest of the week." This response reminds the child how he can meet his goals in an acceptable way and an appropriate consequence can then be given. Parents should be encouraged to address the expectations for their home and children in a family meeting or in regular discussions with their child outside the context of the child's lying. Regardless of age or developmental level, when lying becomes a common way of managing conflict, intervention is warranted. If this behavior cannot be resolved through the parents' understanding of the situation and the child's understanding that lying is not a reasonable alternative, a mental health evaluation is indicated. Many children steal something at some point in their lives. Often, when very young children steal, the behavior is an impulsive action to acquire something they want. A common example is the child who takes candy or a toy from the store shelf. If a parent notices this behavior, they can use the situation as a teaching opportunity to explain that community and family expectations are that we have to pay for things at the store and not take them without permission. It should not be expected that a very young child will be aware of all the rules around shopping or stealing. It may also be difficult for a child who has been used to being able to freely take what- ever she wants to be aware of all the expected behaviors across different set- tings. When preschoolers and school-age children begin to steal frequently even after they have been told not to, the behavior may be a response to stressful environmental circumstances and requires further exploration and evaluation. For some older children, stealing can be an expression of anger or revenge for perceived frustrations with parents or other authority figures. In such instances, stealing becomes one way the child and adolescent can manipulate and attempt to control their world. Stealing can also be learned from adults. Some children will report that the behavior is "exciting" for them, and they may also engage in the behavior for peer approval. In some cases, youth living in poverty may engage in the behavior as a survival mechanism. Kleptomania, an impulse-control disorder, may begin in adoles- cence and is characterized by an intense impulse to steal objects that may not be rationally needed by the patient. There are often comor- bid disorders such as anxiety, eating disorders, substance misuse, and depression. Treatment includes cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in addition to various drugs such as lithium, naltrexone, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Parents should work with their children to rectify stealing through restitution. Parents should require that their child return stolen items or pay for them with their own money (i.e., allowance or gift money). When this is not possible, another reasonable consequence should be given, such as losing a privilege or completing additional chores. When stealing is part of a pattern of broader conduct problems, referral for a mental health evaluation is warranted. TRUANCY Truancy and running away are never developmentally appropriate. Truancy may represent an unsafe environment of disorganization within the home including lack of appropriate supervision or older children being required to caretake for younger siblings. Truancy can also be a sign of developing conduct problems or behavioral health problems including depression or anxiety. When truancy occurs in younger children, there are usually psychosocial concerns with the parents or adult caretakers in the home that prevent them from fol- lowing through with the required demands of getting their children to school each day. Families struggling with housing and food insecurity may have difficulties having their children attend school regularly. Par- ents with intellectual disability or their own mental health or substance abuse problems may become overwhelmed with managing the home and caring for their children; thus they might not consistently ensure their child gets to school. In addition, children might decide to remain at home to take care of parents who are impaired. Truancy is more common in preteens and adolescents and can be a function of multiple factors, including but not limited to learning dif- ficulties, social anxiety, depression, traumatic exposure, bullying, peer pressure, and substance use. In any of these cases, the child should be referred for further evaluation to assess the barriers to returning to school. Best practices for dealing with truancy resulting from school avoidance and anxiety include addressing the underlying psychologic symptoms causing the school avoidance and empowering parents, chil- dren, and school staff to work on a consistent plan for a return to school. Younger children may threaten running away out of frustration or a "get back at" parents. Older children who run away are almost always expressing a serious underlying problem within themselves or their family, including violence, abuse, and neglect. Adolescent runaways are at high risk for substance abuse and other risk-taking behaviors as well as at risk for being victims of abuse (e.g., sexual exploitation). Youth exhibiting truancy or running away should be referred for a mental health evaluation. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. 

Chapter 45 Aggression Keneisha R. Sinclair-McBride, Erica H. Lee, David R. DeMaso, and Heather J. Walter Aggressive behavior is a serious symptom associated with signifi- cant morbidity and mortality. Early intervention is indicated for persistent aggressive behavior given that children may not simply "grow out of" this pattern of behavior. Aggressive tendencies are heritable, although environmental factors can promote aggression in susceptible children. Both enduring and temporary stressors affecting a family can increase aggressive behavior in children. Aggression in childhood is correlated with both poverty and chaotic family situations, including chronic unemployment, family discord, and exposure to community and domestic violence, criminality, and psychiatric disorders. Children born to teenage mothers and parents with limited resources and support are also at risk. Males are reported to be more aggressive than females. A difficult tem- perament and later aggressiveness are related. When children with temperament difficulties are responded to with punitive discipline strategies within the family environment, it can set up a cycle of increasing aggression. Aggressive children often misinterpret social cues in such a way that they perceive hostile intent in ambiguous or benign interactions, and then may react with verbal or physical aggression toward peers and parents. It is important to differentiate the causes and motives for child- hood aggression. Intentional aggression may be primarily instru- mental (i.e., to achieve an end), primarily hostile (i.e., to inflict physical or psychologic pain), or primarily impulsive. Impulsive aggression can often be effectively managed with simple behavioral interventions at home. Children who are callous, not empathetic, and more consistently aggressive require intervention in the spe- cialty mental health setting (see Chapter 42). These children are at high risk for suspension from school and eventual school failure. Because learning disorders are common in this population, aggres- sive children should be referred for screening. Aggressive behav- ior is often present in a variety of other psychologic conditions, disorders (see Chapters 39 and 42). Aggressive behavior in males is relatively consistent from the pre- school period through adolescence. Without effective intervention, a male with a high level of aggressive behavior between 3 and 6 years of age has a high probability of carrying this behavior into adolescence. The developmental progression of aggression among females is less well studied. Fewer females show physically aggres- sive behavior in early childhood. However, interpersonal coercive behavior, especially in peer relationships, is seen in females. This behavior may be related to the development of physical aggression for females in adolescence (e.g., fighting) or other conduct prob- lems (e.g., stealing). Children exposed to aggressive models on television, in video games, or in play have more aggressive behavior compared with children not exposed to these models. Parents' anger and aggressive or harsh pun- ishment can model behavior that children may imitate when they are physically or psychologically hurt. Parents' abuse may be transmitted to the next generation by several modes: children imitate aggression Chapter 46 • Self-Injurious Behavior 283 that they have witnessed; abuse can cause neurologic damage, which itself predisposes the child to violence; and internalized rage often Aggressive behavior in youth is often oriented toward peers through bullying (see Chapter 15.1). Although it is developmentally normative for children to engage in some teasing behavior, bullying has a more serious tone. Bullying is defined as unwanted aggressive behavior in which there is a real or perceived imbalance of power or strength between the bully and the victim. Typically, it involves a pattern of behavior repeated over time. Although most often per- ceived as physical aggression, bullying can take on a variety of forms, including relational bullying, the most common form engaged in by females. Cyberbullying is a particular risk during the middle and high school years because of increased exposure and access to mul- tiple social media platforms at this developmental stage. Parents should be advised to closely monitor their child's social media and maintain open communication with their children. Children may bully others because of impulse-control and social skills deficits, strong need for power and negative dominance, satisfaction in caus- ing harm to others, or psychologic or material rewards. Children who bully are at risk for a variety of negative school and psychologic Victims of bullying are particularly at risk for negative outcomes, especially if the behavior is not addressed by adults. Victimization experiences are associated with school avoidance and school drop- out, social isolation, somatic symptoms, and increased psychologic problems such as depression and anxiety. There have been numer- ous cases of suicide in children who reported a prior history of being bullied. Should a concern arise around bullying in the school setting, parents should be advised to reach out to their child's teacher, school counselor, and school administrative staff to have the bullying behavior addressed. Many schools also have a bullying intervention protocol that can be implemented, and state depart- ments of education have antibullying policies with formal proto- cols to address concerns. Given the significant psychologic risks for both victims and perpetrators of bullying, it is essential that all children who are persistently involved in these incidents be referred for mental health evaluation.

284 Part Ill • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders Although NSSI and suicidal behavior are distinct constructs based on the intent of the behavior, they are also highly comorbid Research exploring the attitudes of youth who have engaged in NSSI indicates that there is a strong identification with suicide and death for this population, which makes NSSI a significant clinical issue and risk factor that cannot be ignored or minimized. Although some youth engage in repeated NSSI without ever attempting sui- cide, studies suggest that 50-75% of adolescents who have a history of NSSI will make a suicide attempt at some point. NSSI has been documented in children as young as 7 years of age, with rates increasing from childhood (~8%) to adolescents (~18%), and decreasing during adulthood (~5.5%). Although traditionally thought to be more prevalent in females than males, NSSI occurs in both sexes. Emerging research suggests that, if present at all, gender differences in rates of NSSI are more likely in clinical than commu- nity populations. Notably, however, rates of NSSI are particularly high among transgender and gender nonconforming teens with up to 55% reporting past-year engagement in NSSI. There are no sig- nificant ethnicity or class differences among youth who engage in NSSI. Youth identified as those with the highest risk include females ages 15-19 and males 20-24. Cutting is the most commonly reported form of NSSI. For those youth who engage in NSSI for the first time, approximately 20% will repeat the behavior within the same year; cutting is the most com- monly repeated method of NSSI. Other methods of NSSI include scratching, burning, carving, piercing, hitting or punching, biting, picking at wounds, and digging nails into the skin. The most com- mon areas of injury are the arms, legs, and torso, though NSSI may also occur on other parts of the body (e.g., breasts, genitals, groin, neck). Objects used in cutting include razors, scissors, broken glass, hard plastic, knives, staples, paper clips, or any other objects sharp enough to cause injury. Importantly, there are gender differences in methods such that females are more likely to engage in cutting, scratching, biting, hair pulling, and wound picking whereas males are more likely to engage in burning and self-battery, including hit- ting and head banging. Youth often report exposure to NSsl before engaging in the behavior. Some vouth report that they have friends who self-injure (e.g., cut) to attempt to alleviate negative emotions. Others may view stories of their peers' engagement in NSSI on websites and social media. Impressionable youth have also reported learning about NSSI for the first time from celebrities who have engaged in NSSI is associated with depression, anxiety, peer (bullying) victimiza- tion, social isolation, low self-esteem, substance abuse, eating disorders, impulsivity, poor school pertormance, delinquency, and neglectful or highly punitive parenting practices, as well as trauma, including a his- tory of physical or sexual abuse. The behavior may begin as an impulsive response to internal distress for younger children, but for those who are older, the behavior can take on a self-reinforcing function. Youth may feel a sense of relief or mastery over negative emotions once the behavior has been completed. Some youth report that they engage in NSSI when feel- ing intense negative emotions, overwhelmed, or panicked to regulate their emotions. Others engage in the behavior when they are feeling numb, to 'feel something" again. NSSI may also serve as a distraction from emo- tional pain, provide a sense of control over the body, or be used as a form of self-punishment for a perceived wrongdoing. NSSI may also function to communicate distress or strength or provide peer group affliation. Youth often report that they are unable to resist the urge to engage in the behavior and will continue to feel increasing levels of distress until they engage in NSSI. Others plan or schedule the behavior, building it into their routine. Youth who view NSSI as an effective, private, and necessary coping strat- egy tend to have more dependence on the behavior and more resistance to Some adolescents and young adults engage in repeated NSs for years without disclosing the behavior. Due to the shame associated with this stigmatized behavior, youth will often go to great lengths to keep it a secret. Some wear bracelets to cover scars on their arms or wear long sleeves in summer to hide the scarring. They report teeling ashamed of the behavior and fear rejection or disappoint- ment from family and friends should they find out. At times, fear of being rejected or a disappointment to others can increase feelings of depression and anxiety and can serve to perpetuate the behavior. In contrast, others are more open about showing their scars and sharing their behavior with others. In either case, the behavior is a way to communicate or manage some level of distress. Many youth who engage in NSSI may never be seen in a hospital emergency department or by a mental health professional. Factors that pro- tect against engagement in NSSI include a lack of awareness of, or exposure to, NSSI; an aversion to physical pain; an aversion to NSSI-related stimuli (e.g., blood); a positive view of the self; the use of other more adaptive emotion regulation strategies; and social norms. Youth with repetitive NSSI should be referred to behavioral health services. Effective treatment strategies include conducting a functional analysis around NSSI behavior, identifying and teach- ing alternative emotion regulation strategies, and reducing access to means to harm oneself. Reduction of NSSI has been observed with dialectical behavior therapy for adolescents, cognitive-behavioral therapy, cognitive analytic therapy, and mentalization-based ther- apy for adolescents. There are no psychopharmacologic treatments that have demonstrated efficacy; thus behavioral approaches should be prioritized. Parents should be advised to monitor youth social media access and be aware of their peer group. Maintaining open communication can assist parents in recognizing an increase in concerning behav- iors or patterns of behaviors. Parents should talk with their child about strategies for managing strong emotions and provide emotion coaching to support their child through experiences of distress. They should also be encouraged to talk with their child about their use of and exposure to drugs and alcohol as substance use can be associated with NSSI. Learning that their child has been engaging in self-injury can be frightening for parents because they are unsure of what to do or why their child is engaging in this behavior. It is important that parents receive psychoeducation about NSSI to reduce common mis- conceptions that make it difficult to understand their child's engage- ment in NSSI and respond effectively. Such information should be digestible and accurate, including written suggestions and examples. Parents should also seek mental health services for their child. It is recommended that the child receive a full assessment for risk of suicide when NSSI is a concern.

Proposed diagnostic criteria include self-inflicted injury without suicidal intent occurring on 5 or more days in the past year, with lack of suicidal intent either stated by the individual or interred by the individuals repeated engagement in a behavior not likely to result in death. The individual expects that the self-injurious behavior will relieve a negative feeling or thought, resolve an interpersonal difficulty, or induce a positive feeling state. The self-injurious behavior is associated with interpersonal dif- ficulties or negative feelings or thoughts, preoccupation with the intended behavior that is difficult to control, or frequent thoughts about the intended behavior. The proposed criteria also specify that the behavior is not socially sanctioned (e.g., body piercing, tattooing) and is not restricted to skin picking or nail biting.

Chapter 47 Childhood Psychoses Jennifer A. Zaspel and Rosa K. Kim Psychosis is a severe disruption of thought, perception, and behav- ior resulting in loss of reality testing. Psychosis can occur as part of a mood disorder, such as major depressive disorder or bipolar I disorder; between mood disorder episodes, as in schizoaffective disorder; or without mood disorder episodes, as in schizophrenia. Transient psychotic episodes can arise during times of psychologic or physiologic stress in patients who are vulnerable because of per- sonality, developmental, or genetic disorders. Positive symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and grossly disorganized behavior, are key features that define psy- choses across disorders, likely because of shared pathophysiologic mechanisms. Negative symptoms, on the other hand, are most typical of schizophrenia. Delusions are fixed, unchangeable, false beliefs held despite con- flicting evidence. They may include a variety of themes, including persecutory, referential (the belief that irrelevant events or details in the world are related directly to oneself), somatic, religious, and grandiose. Delusions are considered bizarre if they are clearly implausible. Hallucinations are vivid, clear, perceptual distur- bances that occur without external stimulus and have the full force and impact of normal perceptions. They may occur in any sensory modality; auditory hallucinations are the most common associated with psychosis. Disorganized thinking is inferred from an indi- vidual's speech by examining their thought process and thought content and is typically severe enough to impair ones ability to communicate. Grossly disorganized behavior may range from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation to catatonic behavior. Negative symptoms include diminished emotional expression, avo- lition (decreased drive to perform purposeful tasks), alogia (lack of speech), anhedonia, and social withdrawal. Negative symptoms account for a substantial portion of the long-term morbidity associ- ated with schizophrenia. Given the centrality of hallucinations and delusions in making a diagnosis of a psychotic illness, their differentiation from developmen- tally normal fantasy is essential. When children are imagining, they control the fantasy and do not have the perceptual experience of see- ing and hearing. When children are hallucinating, they do not control the hallucination. Almost two thirds of children will endorse at least one psychotic-like experience, most often a hallucination. When not persistent or accompanied by distress, these experiences are not usu- ally a cause for concern. The largest population-based study to date evaluating psychotic symptoms and neurocognition in youth 11-21 years old found that those who endorsed more psychotic-like experi- ences than is typical for their age had reduced accuracy across neuro- cognitive domains, reduced global functioning, and increased risk of depression, anxiety, behavioral disorders, substance use, and suicidal ideation. Thus psychotic-like symptoms that are frequent, distressing, and cause impairment signal a need for further evaluation and moni- toring; however, only a small minority of these children will develop persisting psychotic illnesses. 47.1 Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Jennifer A. Zaspel and Rosa K. Kim Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) include brief psychotic disorder, schizophreni- form disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, substance/ Chapter 47 • Childhood Psychoses 285 medication-induced psychotic disorder, psychotic disorder caused by another medical condition, catatonia associated with another mental disorder, catatonic disorder due to another medical condi- tion, unspecihed catatonia, delusional disorder, schizotypal personal- ity disorder, and other specified/unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. DESCRIPTION The schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are pri- marily characterized by the presence of symptoms of psychosis, spe- cifically delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by the duration of one or more of these symptoms for at least 1 day but less than 1 month followed by complete resolution. Emergence of symptoms may or may not be preceded by an identifiable stressor (Table 47.1). Although brief, the level of impairment in this disorder may be severe enough that supervision is required to ensure that basic needs are met and that the individual is protected from the consequences of poor judgment and cognitive impairment. If two or more psychotic symptoms persist for between 1 and 6 months, the condition is called schizophreniform disorder (Table 47.2). To meet DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia, two or more psy- chotic symptoms must have been present for a significant portion of time for at least 1 month (unless suppressed by treatment), and the level of psychosocial functioning must either be markedly below the level achieved before the onset or there is failure to achieve the expected level of functioning. In addition, there must be continuous signs of the disturbance for at least 6 months (Table 47.3). Individuals with schizophrenia can display inappropriate affect, dysphoric mood, disturbed sleep patterns, and lack of interest in eating, or food refusal. Depersonalization, derealization, somatic concerns, and anxiety and phobias are common. Cognitive deficits are observed, including decrements in declarative memory, work- ing memory, language function, and other executive functions, as well as slower processing speed. These individuals may have no Table 47.1 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Brief Psychotic Disorder A. Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms.

Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but less than 1 mo, with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning. C. The disturbance is not better explained by major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features or another psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or catatonia, and is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

Without marked stressor(s): If the symptoms do not occur in response to events that, singly or together, would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in the individual's culture.

Hostility and aggression can be associated with schizophrenia, although spontaneous or random assault is uncommon. Aggression is more frequent for younger males and for individuals with a his- tory of violence, nonadherence with treatment, substance abuse, and impulsivity. The essential features of schizophrenia are the same in childhood as in adulthood, but it is more difficult to make the diagnosis. In chil- dren, delusions and hallucinations may be less elaborate, visual hal- lucinations may be more common, and disorganized speech may be better attributed to an autism spectrum or communication disorder. In youth with schizophrenia, the most frequent psychotic symptoms are auditory hallucinations (82%), delusions (78%), thought disorder (66%), disorganized or bizarre behavior (53%), and negative symp- toms (50%). Childhood-onset schizophrenia tends to represent a more severe form of the disorder spectrum, with more genetic risk factors, more brain abnormalities, and more prominent prepsychotic develop- mental disorders. EPIDEMIOLOGY Brief psychotic disorder is reported to account for 9% of first-onset psychosis in the United States and is more common in females than males. The incidence of schizophreniform disorders in the United States appears as much as fivefold less than that of schizophrenia. The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is approximately 0.3-0.7%, although variations are reported by race/ethnicity, across coun- tries, and by geographic origin for immigrants. The male-to-female ratio is approximately 1.4:1. Males generally have poorer premor- bid adjustment, lower educational achievement, more prominent negative symptoms, and more cognitive impairment than females.

For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved before the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning). C. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 mo. This 6 mo period must include at least 1 mo of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences). D. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either (1) no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms or (2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness. E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. F. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present for at least a month (or less if successfully treated).

Childhood (preadolescent)-onset is exceedingly rare, with an inci- dence of less than 0.04%, and 2:1 ratio in males versus females. CLINICAL COURSE Brief psychotic disorder most often appears in adolescence or early adulthood, with the average age of onset in the mid-30s but can occur throughout the life span. A diagnosis of brief psychotic dis- order requires full remission within 1 month of onset and gradual return to premorbid level of function. The age of onset of schizo- phreniform disorder is similar to that of schizophrenia. Recov- ery from an episode of the disorder is within 6 months; however, about 65% of patients relapse and eventually receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Abrupt onset, confusion, absence of blunted affect, and good premorbid functioning predict a better outcome in schizophreniform disorder. Schizophrenia typically develops between the late teens and the mid-30s; onset before adolescence is rare. The peak age at onset for the first psychotic episode is in the early to mid-20s for males and in the late 20s for females. The onset may be abrupt or insidious, but most individuals manifest a slow and gradual development of symptoms, with about 50% of individuals complaining of depres- sive symptoms. The predictors of course and outcome are largely unexplained. The course is favorable in approximately 20% of cases; a small number of individuals are reported to recover com- pletely. However, many remain chronically ill, with exacerbations and remissions of active symptoms, whereas others experience 

progressive deterioration. Most individuals diagnosed with schizo- phrenia require some form of daily living support. Positive symp- toms tend to diminish over time, and negative symptoms are the most persistent, along with cognitive deficits. It is important to recognize hallmark phases in the assessment and management of schizophrenia. In the prodrome phase, most patients experience functional deterioration over the course of months (e.g., social withdrawal, idiosyncratic preoccupations, unusual behaviors, academic failure, deteriorating self-care skills, and/or dysphoria) before the onset of overt psychotic symptoms. The acute phase is characterized by prominent positive symp- toms and deterioration in functioning and is the phase in which most patients present for care. During the recovery phase, nega- tive symptoms and disorganization may persist as active psychosis remits. The residual phase has minimal to no positive symptoms, although negative symptoms may cause continued impairment. Some patients will experience chronic impairment despite ade- quate treatment. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The differential diagnosis for the psychotic disorders is broad and includes reactions to substances/medications (dextromethorphan, LSD, hallucinogenic mushrooms, psilocybin, peyote, cannabis, stimulants, inhalants, corticosteroids, anesthetics, anticholiner- gics, antihistamines, amphetamines); medical conditions causing psychotic-like symptoms (Table 47.4; see Table 32.4); and other psy- chiatric disorders (depressive, bipolar, obsessive-compulsive, facti- tious, body dysmorphic, posttraumatic stress, autism spectrum, Chapter 47 • Childhood Psychoses 287 communication, personality). The differential diagnosis can be dif- ficult because many conditions that can be mistaken for psychosis also increase the risk for it. There are many indications that suggest psychotic symptoms may be related to a physical illness rather than a primarily psychiatric ill- ness (Table 47.5). When psychotic symptoms are caused by identifi- able medical conditions, there are often impairments in attention, orientation, recent memory, and intellectual function. Hallucina- tions associated with medical illness are more often tactile or visual, whereas auditory hallucinations are more common in primary psy- chotic disorders. Patients whose hallucinations are caused by medi- cal illness are more likely to recognize that they do represent reality. A positive family or prior personal history of psychosis or other serious psychiatric illnesses is less likely to be present. Autoimmune encephalitis caused by anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor or other autoantibodies may manifest with psychosis, anxiety, depression, agitation, aggression, delusions, catatonia, visual or auditory hallucinations, disorientation, and paranoia in combination with sleep disturbances, autonomic dys- function, dyskinesias, movement disorders, seizures, memory loss, and a depressed level of consciousness (Fig. 47.1; see Table 32.5). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and MRI are usually, but not always, abnormal. The constellation of a relatively rapid onset psychosis and encephalitic features should suggest the diagnosis, although at presentation, behavioral problems may be the dominant feature (see Chapter 638.4; Table 47.6). A small number of patients present with purely psychiatric symptoms without other neurologic findings. Determining when identifiable medical conditions are caus- ing delirium with prominent psychotic symptoms may be difficult Table 47.4 Possible Causes of Secondary Psychosis Trauma Autoimmune disorders Cytogenetic/congenital disorders Toxic/substance-induced disorders latrogenic disorders Cerebrovascular disorders Space-occupying disorders Metabolic disorders Dietary disorders Sepsis/infectious disorders EXAMPLES Traumatic head injury Systemic lupus erythematosus, NMDA receptor encephalitis and others Velocardiofacial syndrome, agenesis of corpus callosum PCP, MDMA, LSD, cannabis, alcohol, cocaine, synthetic cannabinoids (bath salts) Lead, mercury or arsenic poisoning, ginseng, St. John's Wort, ma huang Antimalarials, steroids, isoniazid Stroke, subdural hematomas Cerebral tumors Pheochromocytoma, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Wilson disease, adult Tay-Sachs disease, acute intermittent porphyria Pellagra, B,2 deficiency; thiamine deficiency Neurosyphilis, toxoplasmosis, HIV disease, encephalitis Unknown cause/degenerative/ demyelinating disorders Seizure disorders Lewy body dementia, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, Friedreich ataxia Partial complex seizures, temporal lobe epilepsy INVESTIGATIONS CT, MRI Autoantibody titers Karyotyping, MRI Careful medication history; urine screen for drugs, heavy metal screen; trial off the offending agent Careful medication history; trial off the offending agent CT, MRI CT, MRI Urinary catecholamines; arylsulfatase-A levels, copper and ceruloplasmin levels B12, folate, thiamine levels RPR to rule out syphilis; HIV antibody titers; glucose, protein in CSF MRI, CT, EEG, evoked potentials EEG, including sleep deprivation; telemetric EEG as indicated Endocrine disorders Hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism Serum calcium, thyroid/parathyroid hormone levels CSF, Cerebrospinal fluid; EEG, electroencephalography; LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide; MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine; NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate; PCP, phencyclidine; RPR, rapid plasma reagin.

In general, delirium is hallmarked by fluctuating levels of consciousness and is often asso- ciated with abnormalities in the neurologic exam and vital signs. Psychosis may be present in patients with delirium, but it will be accompanied by clear signs and symptoms of physical illness. The diagnosis of a psychotic disorder should be made only after other explanations for the observed symptoms have been thor- oughly considered. Mistakenly diagnosing psychosis when it is not present can lead to inappropriate use of antipsychotics with their attendant risks. The persistence, frequency, and form of possible psychotic symptoms, as well as the degree of accompanying distress and functional regression, need to be considered in determining the likelihood of an underlying psychotic pathophysiology.

Table 47.6 Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Autoimmune Psychosis For a diagnosis of possible autoimmune psychosis: The patient must have current psychotic symptoms of abrupt onset (rapid progression of <3 months) with at least one of the following: • Currently or recently diagnosed with a tumor : Adveme response o antipsych otics, raising suspicion of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (rigidity, hyperthermia, or raised creatine kinase) • Severe or disproportionate cognitive dysfunction : The occurrence of seizures that are not explained by a previously known seizure disorder • A clinically significant autonomic dysfunction (abnormal or unexpectedly fluctuant blood pressure, temperature, or heart rate) If a patient has possible autoimmune psychosis, they should be investigated as per section 5 ("Consensus multimodal approach to the systematic investigation of patients with suspected autoimmune psychosis*), including electroencephalography, MRI, serum autoantibodies, and CSF analysis (including CSF autoantibodies). The results should lead to a diagnosis of non-autoimmune psychosis or probable/definite autoimmune psychosis. For a diagnosis of probable autoimmune psychosis: The patient must have current psychotic symptoms of abrupt onset (rapid progression of <3 mo) with at least one of the seven clinical criteria listed previously for possible autoimmune psychosis and at least one of the following: : Clarela cross of maltite n 12 elighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery MRI highly restricted to the medial temporal lobes Or two of the following: • Electroencephalogram encephalopathic changes (i.e., spikes, spike- wave activity, or rhythmic slowing [intermittent rhythmic delta or theta activity] focal changes, or extreme delta brush : The presence baseds inciner i a idedy detected by cell based After exclusion of alternative diagnoses. For a diagnosis of definite autoimmune psychosis: The patient must meet the criteria for probable autoimmune psychosis with IgG class antineuronal antibodies in CSF. Note that these criteria do not exclude a diagnosis being made in a patient with an acute onset (<3 mo) of psychosis, even if that patient has had a previous psychotic, other psychiatric, or encephalopathic episode that resolved.

COMORBIDITY Among youth with schizophrenia, rates of comorbidity are approxi- mately 34% for posttraumatic stress disorder, 34% for attention- deficit/hyperactivity and/or disruptive behavior disorders, and 32% for substance abuse/dependence. At least 10-20% of children diag- nosed with schizophrenia have intellectual delays; it is unclear if this is related to the impact of the illness on cognitive testing. Chil- dren with schizophrenia also demonstrate impairments in language, communication, and information processing. Co-occurring rates of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are higher than would be expected in general populations; childhood-onset schizo- phrenia has been linked to ASD, with an estimated 30-50% of cases preceded by a diagnosis of an ASD. SEQUELAE Follow-up studies of early-onset schizophrenia suggest moderate to severe impairment across the life span. Poor outcome is predicted by low pre- morbid functioning, insidious onset, higher rates of negative symptoms, childhood onset, and low intellectual functioning. When followed into adulthood, youth with schizophrenia demonstrated greater social deficits, lower levels of employment, and lower likelihood of independent living, relative to those with other childhood psychotic disorders. Approximately 5-10% of individuals with schizophrenia die by suicide or accidental death directly related to behaviors caused by psychotic thinking, approximately 20% attempt suicide on one or more occasions, and many more have suicidal ideation. Life expec- tancy is reduced in individuals with schizophrenia because of asso- ciated medical conditions; a shared vulnerability for psychosis and medical disorders may explain some of the medical comorbidity of ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS Etiologic evidence for schizophrenia supports a neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative model, with multiple genetic and environmen- tal risks having important roles. It has been hypothesized that although psychotic disorders have their origins in early development, it is not until youth are in their mid-teens that the underlying neural struc- tures manifest the disabling functional deficits and resultant psychotic Genetic Factors The lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia is 5-20 times higher in first-degree relatives of affected probands than the general popula- tion. Concordance rates of 40-60% and 5-15% have been reported in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, respectively. Genome-wide association studies have implicated variants in >100 different genes that are statistically significant but individually only demonstrate small increases in the risk for schizophrenia. The risk for schizo- phrenia increases with increasing burden of these risk alleles; approximately 30% of the risk is attributable to common genetic variants. Rare variants of larger effect have also been implicated as increasing risk. Some rare copy number variants, where segments of the genome encompassing many genes are either duplicated or deleted, increase the risk of schizophrenia more markedly, with odds ratios of 2-25. Although these copy number variants may be responsible for 0.5-1.0% of typical adolescent/adult-onset schizo- phrenia, data indicate that they are responsible for about 12% of schizophrenia cases with onset before age 13 years. Environmental Factors In utero exposure to maternal famine, advanced paternal age, pre- natal infections, obstetric complications, marijuana use, and immi- gration have been hypothesized to contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Cannabis use in teens is associated with a higher risk of eventually developing psychosis, but it is difficult to determine whether this is related to drug effects or an unmasking of underlying Chapter 47 • Childhood Psychoses 289 disease potential. Environmental exposures may mediate disease risk through direct neurologic damage, gene-environment interac- tions, epigenetic effects, or de novo mutations. There is no evidence that psychologic or social factors alone cause schizophrenia. Rather, environmental factors potentially interact with biologic risk factors to mediate the timing of onset, course, and severity of an acute epi- sode. Expressed emotion within the family setting can influence the onset and exacerbation of acute episodes and relapse rates. NEUROANATOMIC ABNORMALITIES Increased lateral ventricle volumes, along with reductions in hippo- campus, thalamus, and frontal lobe volumes, have been reported in schizophrenia. Youth with schizophrenia have reductions in gray mat- ter volumes and reduced cortical folding. Neurotransmitter systems, particularly central nervous system dopamine circuits, are hypoth- esized to have a key role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The dopamine hypothesis is derived in part from the identification of D2 receptor blockade as the mechanism for the action of antipsychotic medications. On neurologic exam, those with schizophrenia are often found to have deficits in smooth-pursuit eye movements and auto- nomic responsivity. PREVENTION There has been significant interest in prospectively identifying youth at risk for schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic dis- orders to provide early intervention before the development of a chronic psychotic disorder. Those considered to be at clinically high risk may express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs. They may have unusual perceptual experiences, including frank hallucinations, but retain insight into their unreality. Their speech and behavior may be unusual, but not overtly disorganized. Individuals who had been socially active may become withdrawn. The symptoms are described as present at least once per week for the past month and have begun or worsened over the past year. Although the symp- toms are less severe and more transient than in a psychotic disorder, 20-40% of patients with these attenuated symptoms appear to go on to a psychotic disorder within several years of symptom presenta- tion. There is evidence that premorbid lower cognitive and social skills as well as a history of substance abuse contribute to the risk of developing a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Some evidence indicates that antipsychotic medication may delay conversion to a psychotic disorder and ameliorate attenuated symp- toms in active treatment, yet there appear to be no lasting effects after the medication is withdrawn. Additionally, the known adverse effects of antipsychotics argue against their being used broadly to prevent psy- chosis in these patients, given that about 65% do not go on to develop a psychotic disorder. Antidepressants with symptomatic improvement in adolescents who are at risk of developing a schizo- phrenia spectrum disorder. Psychologic interventions, including social skills, cognitive, and interaction training programs, as well as educational family interventions and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), are reported to improve symptoms and psychosocial func- tioning in youth with early symptoms and decrease the rate of con- version to psychosis. Despite improvements in diagnostic predictive validity, significant concern remains regarding a high false-positive rate that may cause individuals to be stigmatized or exposed to unnecessary treatment. In this context, youth with early symptoms suggestive of psychosis should be referred to a child and adolescent psychiatrist or other qualified mental health specialist. SCREENING There are no validated tools for screening for schizophrenia spectrum disorders in children or adolescents. A widely accepted premorbid phenotype for childhood-onset schizophrenia has yet to be established. 

290 Part Ill • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders Of children with childhood-onset schizophrenia, 67% show distur- bances in social, motor, and language functioning, as well as learning disabilities. Many meet criteria for comorbid ASDs, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders. Pediatric practitioners can make general inquiries of youth and parents regarding problems with thinking or perceptions, including hallucinations and delusions. For younger children, the clinician must ensure that the child understands the questions. True psychotic symptoms are generally confusing to the individual. Highly descriptive, detailed, organized, and situation-specific reports are less likely to represent true psychosis. Overt evidence of psychosis is not always present on mental status examination, but in the absence of this, the validity of symptom reports should be scrutinized. Given the strong genetic component of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, a thorough family history is key in supporting the workup of psychosis in children. Youth presenting with possible psychosis warrant assess- ment and treatment by a child and adolescent psychiatrist or other qualified mental health specialist. ASSESSMENT The diagnostic assessment of schizophrenia in youth is uniquely complicated; misdiagnosis is common. Most children who report hallucinations do not meet criteria for schizophrenia, and many do not have a psychotic illness. The persistence, frequency, and form of possible psychotic symptoms; the presence of distress; functional impairment; and insight need to be considered in arriving at a diag- nosis. Expertise in childhood psychopathology and experience in assessing reports of psychotic symptoms in youth are important prerequisite skills for clinicians evaluating youth for psychosis. Comprehensive diagnostic assessments, which reconcile mental status findings with the rigorous application of diagnostic criteria, help improve accuracy. All children who present with psychotic symptoms should receive a thorough pediatric and neurologic evaluation to focus on ruling out nonpsychiatric causes of psychosis (see Tables 47.4 and 32.4). There is no neuroimaging or laboratory test that establishes a diag- nosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders; these diagnostic tests are instead used to further assist with the medical evaluation while also establishing baseline laboratory parameters for monitoring medication therapy. Routine laboratory testing typically includes blood counts; basic metabolic panel; and assessment of liver, renal, and thyroid function. More extensive evaluation is indicated for atypical presentations, such as a gross deterioration in cognitive and motor abilities, focal neurologic symptoms, or delirium (see Table 47.5). Neuroimaging may be indicated when neurologic deficits are present, or BEG may be indicated for a clinical history suggestive of seizures or encephalopathy. Toxicology screens are indicated for acute onset or exacerbations of psychosis when exposure to drugs of abuse cannot be ruled out. Genetic testing is indicated if there are associated dysmorphic or syndromic features. Tests to rule out specific syndromes or diseases are indicated for clinical presenta- tions suggestive of a specific syndrome (e.g., amino acid screens for inborn errors of metabolism, ceruloplasmin for Wilson disease, porphobilinogen for acute intermittent porphyria, neuronal anti- bodies for autoimmune encephalitis). Neuropsychologic testing cannot establish the diagnosis but may be important for document- ing cognitive deficits for academic planning. TREATMENT Treatment goals include decreasing psychotic symptomatology, direct- ing the child toward a developmentally typical trajectory, and reinte- grating the child into the home and community. Children and families facing schizophrenia spectrum disorders require an array of mental health services to address their psychologic, social, educational, and cultural needs. Given the insidious onset and chronic course of these disorders, the patient must be followed longitudinally, with periodic reassessment to hone diagnostic accuracy and tailor services to meet the patient's and family's needs. Integrated psychopharmacologic, psy- chotherapeutic, psychoeducational, and case management services are often necessary. Psychoeducation about the illness with an assessment of the potential role of stigma in treatment participation is critical for improving adherence with treatment recommendations. Assessing a child's strengths and vulnerabilities as well as available environ- mental resources is critical in devising an effective treatment plan. School and community liaison work to develop and maintain a day- to-day schedule for the patient is important. Specialized educational programs should be considered within the school system. Cogni- tive remediation has led to some promising gains in planning ability and cognitive flexibility. Effective and collaborative communication among the family, the pediatrician, a child and adolescent psychia- trist, and other mental health providers increases the potential for the patient's optimal functioning. Pharmacotherapy First-generation (typical) and second -generation (atypical) antipsy- chotic medications are effective in reducing psychotic symptoms. Antipsychotics appear to outperform placebo and to have approxi- mately equal effectiveness, except for ziprasidone and clozapine, which may be less and more effective than the others, respectively. Risperidone, aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine, and lurasidone are FDA-approved second-generation antipsychotics for treating schizophrenia in patients 13 years and older, and paliperidone for those 12 years and older. Several first-generation antipsychotics are also FDA-approved for children and adolescents. The choice of which agent to use first is typically based on FDA approval status, side effect profile, patient and family preference, clinician famil- iarity, and cost. Although clozapine is effective in treating both positive and negative symptoms, it has a risk for agranulocytosis and seizures, which limits its use to those patients with treatment- resistant disorders. Ziprasidone and paliperidone are associated with QT prolongation; this finding along with the inferior effective- ness of ziprasidone limits its use with children and adolescents. All antipsychotics carry some degree of risk of sedation, weight gain, and extrapyramidal symptoms (see Chapter 33). Most patients require long-term treatment and are at significant risk of relapse if their medication is discontinued. However, more than 75% of youth with schizophrenia discontinue their medica- tion within 6 months. Common reasons for discontinuation include lack of efficacy, intolerable side effects, and general lack of adher- ence with treatment plan. Many patients will continue to experience some degree of positive or negative symptoms, requiring ongoing treatment. Patients should maintain regular physician contact to monitor symptom course, side effects, and adherence. Depot or long-acting injectable antipsychotics have not been studied well in pediatric age groups and have inherent risks with long-term expo- sure to adverse side effects. They are typically only considered when there is a well-documented history of psychotic symptoms as well as poor medication adherence. Electroconvulsive Therapy Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used with severely impaired adolescents if medications are either not helpful or cannot be toler- ated. It has not been systematically studied in children, but its use is supported in adults with schizophrenia, typically in combination with antipsychotic therapy.

47.2 Non-Schizophrenia Spectrum Psychotic Disorders Jennifer A. Zaspel and Rosa K. Kim Beyond the schizophrenia spectrum of psychotic disorders, substance/ medication-induced psychotic disorder (Table 47.7) and psychotic dis- order due to another medical condition (Table 47.8) can be seen in pediatric populations. The hallmark features of substance/medication-induced psy- chosis are delusions and hallucinations that develop within the context of substance exposure: typically a drug of abuse, a medica- tion, or a toxin exposure (see Tables 47.4 and 32.4 for a brief list). Synthetic cannabinoids (bath salts) are a common drug producing psychotic effects. A substance-induced psychosis is distinguished from a primary psychotic disorder by examining the onset and course of symptoms; the onset of a primary psychosis may precede substance exposure and may occur during periods of sustained abstinence. Once they arise, psychotic symptoms may be present as long as substance exposure is continued. Although the prevalence of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder in the general Table 47.7 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/ Medication Induced Psychotic Disorder A.

Chapter 47 • Childhood Psychoses 291 population is unknown, it is estimated that 7-25% of individuals presenting with a first episode of psychosis meet criteria for this diagnosis. Symptoms can be managed with antipsychotics until they remit, which often happens shortly after the offending substance is removed. Patients can develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder following substance exposure, but this tends to occur in individuals who are at high risk for developing a primary psychotic disorder regardless of substance exposure. Psychosis due to another medical condition (see Table 47.8) is also characterized by prominent hallucinations or delusions, but history, physical exam, and laboratory findings support a direct pathophysiologic connection between these symptoms and another medical condition (see Tables 32.4, 47.4, 47.5, and 47.8). Any sen- sory modality can be affected by hallucinations. The hallucinations vary in complexity depending on their etiology, and their descrip- tion may be highly suggestive of a particular diagnosis, like olfac- tory hallucinations in temporal lobe epilepsy. Associations between delusions and medical conditions tend to be less specific. The list of medical conditions that can cause psychosis is long, and includes epilepsy, strokes, neoplasms, endocrine disorders, genetic syn- dromes like velocardiofacial syndrome, autoimmune disorders, and the permanent sequelae of toxic exposures (see Tables 32.4 and 47.4). Notably, delirium is excluded from psychosis due to another medical condition. When narrowing the differential between schizophrenia spectrum disorders, psychosis due to another medi- cal condition, and any other etiology, it is important to consider the timeline of symptoms, the presence of features that are atypical for a primary psychosis, and the possibility of substance or medica- tion exposure. Treatment of the underlying medical condition may or may not require adjunctive antipsychotic treatment for manage- ment of psychosis, and the course and prognosis of the psychosis will likely depend on the etiology. A notable example of psychosis due to another medical condi- tion is psychosis associated with epilepsy. The disorder manifests with delusions or hallucinations associated with poor insight, and can be further differentiated into ictal, interictal, and postictal psy- chosis. Ictal-induced psychosis is a form of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, usually a complex partial status that can last for hours to days and is associated with periods of impaired consciousness. Brief interictal psychosis can last days to weeks and is associated with paranoia, delusions, and auditory hallucinations. Chronic interictal psychosis resembles schizophrenia and manifests with paranoia, visual hallucinations, and catatonia. Postictal psychosis is the most common type (observed in 2-7% of patients with epilepsy) and lasts up to 1 week and then spontaneously remits. The diagnosis requires a strong index of suspicion and EEG monitoring. Treat- ment requires appropriate anticonvulsant drugs and, if the psycho- sis persists, initiating low-dose antipsychotic medication.

Kim Catatonia is a constellation or syndrome of psychomotor features, the most notable of which are decreased purposeful motor activity, decreased engagement in interviews and physical exams, or exces- sive and peculiar motor activity. The most characteristic symptoms are waxy flexibility and bizarre poses, but these may or may not be present (Table 47.9). Diagnosis can be challenging, as psycho- motor disturbances can range from unresponsiveness to agitation. Catatonia has been associated with a broad array of conditions affecting children, adolescents, and adults, including psychotic, affective, drug-related, autoimmune, encephalitic, and neurodevel- opmental conditions (Table 47.10). Autoimmune encephalitis may be the most common etiology in childhood. In addition, catatonia (autism shut down syndrome) may complicate ASD (Chapter 58). 

292 Part III • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders Table 47.9 Catatonia Excitement: Extreme hyperactivity; constant motor unrest, which is apparently nonpurposeful Immobility/stupor: Extreme hypoactivity, immobility; minimally responsive to stimuli Mutism: Verbally unresponsive or minimally responsive Staring: Fixed gaze, little or no visual scanning of environment, decreased blinking Posturing/catalepsy: Maintains posture(s), including mundane (e.g., sitting or standing for hours without reacting) Grimacing: Maintenance of odd facial expressions Echopraxia/echolalia: Mimics of examiner's movements/speech Stereotypy: Repetitive, non-goal-directed motor activity (e.g., finger play; repeatedly touching, patting, or rubbing self) Mannerisms: Odd, purposeful movements (hopping or walking tiptoe, saluting passersby, exaggerated caricatures of mundane movements) Verbigeration: Repetition of phrases or sentences Rigidity: Maintenance of a rigid posture despite efforts to be moved Negativism: Apparently motiveless resistance to instructions or to attempts to move/examine the patient; contrary behavior does the opposite of the instruction Waxy flexibility: During reposturing of the patient, offers initial resistance before allowing themselves to be repositioned (similar to that of bending a warm candle) Withdrawal: Refusal to eat, drink, or make eye contact Impulsivity: Suddenly engaging in inappropriate behavior (e.g., runs down the hallway, starts screaming, or takes off clothes) without provocation; afterward, cannot explain Automatic obedience: Exaggerated cooperation with examiner's request, or repeated movements that are requested once Passive obedience (mitgehen): Raising arm in response to light pressure of finger, despite instructions to the contrary Negativism (gegenhalten): Resistance to passive movement that is proportional to strength of the stimulus; response seems automatic rather than willful Ambitendency: Appears stuck in indecisive, hesitant motor movements Grasp reflex: Striking the patient's open palm with two extended fingers of the examiner's hand results in automatic closure of the patient's hand Perseveration: Repeatedly returns to the same topic or persists with the same movements Combativeness: Belligerence or aggression, usually in an undirected manner, without explanation Autonomic abnormality: Abnormality of body temperature (fever), blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, inappropriate sweating From Dhossche DM, Wachtel LE.

Catatonia: A review. Ann Clin Psychiatry. 2008;20(2):97-107: Table 2. The exact pathophysiology of catatonia is unknown, but neuroana- tomic, neuroendocrine, immunologic, and neurotransmitter-based theories have all been proposed based on the various underlying etiologies of catatonia. Morbidity and mortality are high in adults who have experienced catatonia and are presumed to be high in pediatric populations based on limited data primarily because of the severity of an underlying illness that could cause catatonia. Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and catatonia tend to be more impaired than those who do not experience catatonia, and suicide rates are estimated to be 500-fold higher than in the general population. Catatonia is defined as 3 or more of the 12 symptoms listed in Table 47.11 and can be described by both etiology and presenta- tion. The DSM-5 broadly splits etiology into presentations related to mental disorders and presentations related to another medical condition, the diagnosis of which must be supported by the patient's history, physical exam, and any accompanying laboratory findings. Pediatric prevalence rates range from 0.6-17% in child psychiatric inpatients and up to 17% in medically hospitalized children, but rates are difficult to determine due to underdiagnosis of the condi- tion. Catatonia can be further subdivided into three presentation categories: stuporous, excited, and malignant. Stuporous presenta- tions are characterized by immobility, mutism, staring, and rigid- ity, whereas excited presentations include prolonged periods of psychomotor agitation. Malignant catatonia is an emergent condi- tion, presenting with hyperthermia, hypertension, rhabdomyolysis, and psychomotor agitation in addition to the psychiatric and motor 

Table 47.12 Standard Examination of Catatonia The method described here is used to complete the 23-item Bush- Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) and the 14 item Bush- Francis Catatonia Screening Instrument (BFCSI). Item definitions on the two scales are the same. The BFCSI measures only the presence or absence of the first 14 signs. Ratings are based solely on observed behaviors during the examination, with the exception of completing the items for "withdrawal" and "autonomic abnormality," which may be based on directly observed behavior or chart documentation. As a general rule, only items that are clearly present should be rated. If the examiner is uncertain as to the presence of an item, rate the item as "0." PROCEDURE 1. Observe the patient while trying to engage in a conversation. 2. The examiner should scratch his or her head in an exaggerated manner. 3. The arm should be examined for cogwheeling. Attempt to reposture and instruct the patient to "keep your arm loose." Move the arm with alternating lighter and heavier force. 4. Ask the patient to extend his or her arm. Place one finger beneath his or her hand and try to raise it slowly after stating, "Do not let me raise your arm. 5. Extend the hand stating, "Do not shake my hand." 6. Reach into your pocket and state, "Stick out your tongue. I want to stick a pin in it." 7. Check for grasp reflex. 8.

The differential diagnosis for this type includes neuroleptic malignant syndrome or serotonin syndrome (see Chapter 33). Most children will present with a stuporous clini- cal picture, whereas the remaining cases present as excited or malig- nant, 19% and 5%, respectively. The severity of symptoms can be measured and tracked using the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale, a validated tool that accompanies a standardized physical examination and observation of patient behavior (Table 47.12). The diagnostic approach is driven by the search for the underlying cause for catatonia and the monitoring of its potentially dangerous effects on the body. Beyond supportive care and discontinuation of any precipitating agents, treatment of catatonia should be expeditious to reduce the medical sequelae of prolonged symptoms. Benzodiazepines, in par- ticular lorazepam, are typically first-line pharmacologic treatment Chapter 47 • Childhood Psychoses 293 for catatonia. Low-dose lorazepam is often trialed as a confirmatory "challenge" for patients with suspected catatonia, where a positive result is improvement or even resolution of symptoms within hours of administration of the medication. If the initial challenge test does reverse symptoms, increasing doses of lorazepam are indicated, with careful monitoring to avoid side effects (Fig. 47.2). Rapid withdrawal of benzodiazepines can, in turn, precipitate catatonia in those who are susceptible. The use of antipsychotics in catatonia is controversial, as they have been associated with an increased inci- dence of malignant catatonia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. ECT has also been used in both adults and children, though it is underutilized due to caretaker and ethical concerns. Its use is typi- cally recommended when other viable treatment options have either not been successful or cannot be safely administered. It has been successful in treating refractory catatonia in children with autism. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. 47.4 Hallucinations of Childhood Jennifer A. Zaspel and Rosa K. Kim Hallucinations are perceptions that occur in the absence of identifi- able external stimuli. Nondiagnostic hallucinations are those that fall within the realm of normal human experience, such as hear- ing footsteps, knocking, or one's name being called. Hypnogogic and hypnopompic hallucinations are experienced as one transi- tions into and out of sleep, respectively, and on their own carry no psychopathologic implications. In younger children, reported hallucinations can reflect a developmentally appropriate blurring between fantasy and reality, especially regarding dreams and imagi- nary friends. Children are also more susceptible to perceptual dis- tortions or illusions (misinterpretations of external stimuli) but may communicate these phenomena to adults in a way that most would interpret as hallucinations. The first clinical task in evaluat- ing youth who report hallucinations is to sort out those associated with severe mental illness from those derived from other causes (Fig. 47.3). Acute phobic hallucinations are benign, common, and typically occur in otherwise healthy preschool children. The hallucinations are often visual or tactile, last 10-60 minutes, and most often occur at night. The children are quite frightened and might complain that bugs or snakes are crawling over themselves and attempt to remove them. The child's fear is not alleviated by reassurance by the parents or phy- sician, and the child is not amenable to reason. Findings on physical and mental status examinations are otherwise normal, and the cause is unknown. Symptoms can persist for 1-3 days, slowly abating over 1-2 weeks. In children with nonpsychotic hallucinations, all other symptoms of psychosis are absent. Nonpsychotic hallucinations typically occur in the context of severe traumatic stress, developmental difficulties, social and emotional deprivation, parents whose own psychopathol- ogy promotes a breakdown in the child's sense of reality, cultural beliefs in mysticism, and unresolved mourning. Auditory hallucinations of voices telling the child to do "bad things" may be associated with disruptive behavior disorders in an unconscious attempt to distance oneself from undesirable behaviors. Hearing a voice invoking suicide is often associated with depression. Trauma-related hallucinations are commonly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder and are likely a representation of flashbacks. Auditory and visual hallucinations may similarly be endorsed in complex bereavement. The content of the hal- lucinations is often relevant in understanding the underlying psycho- pathology and developmental issues.

It is not a primary psy- chiatric diagnosis and instead occurs secondary to an underlying med- ical condition, though at the time of initial presentation the underlying cause is often unknown. The symptoms of delirium are similar between adults and children. Delirium in children carries risks of adverse out- comes, including death, if it is not treated. Untreated delirium can serve to prolong the recovery course of comorbid and underlying conditions; the clinical features of delirium, including agitation, aggression, and confusion, can often interfere with necessary medical care. Delirium in children and adolescents is associated with a 12.5-29% mortality rate. Quick recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of delirium and its underlying cause is essential in ensuring the best outcome for patients. DIAGNOSIS Criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are included in the DSM-5 under Neurocognitive Disorders (Table 48.1). Delirium presents with an acute onset, developing quickly over the course of hours to days and symptoms tend to wax and wane. This fluctuation of symptoms can be dramatic over the course of a day, with a patient appearing

The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to a few days), represents a change from baseline attention and awareness, and tends to fluctuate in severity during the course of a day. D. The disturbances in Criteria A and C are not explained by another preexisting, established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder and do not occur in the context of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma. E. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or aboratory findings that the disturbance is a direct physiologic consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal (i.e., due to a drug of abuse or to a medication), or exposure to a toxin, or is due to multiple etiologies.

At the core of delirium is an alteration in attention and awareness, and a disturbance in cognition. Patients with delirium will struggle to focus and sustain attention. They are often disoriented, showing confusion about where they are, poor orientation to time, and sometimes disorientation to self. In addition to these core features, delirium often presents with symptoms that have the potential to be mistaken for psychosis or mania. People with delir- ium may hallucinate, engage in bizarre or purposeless movements, and show alterations in their sleep-wake cycles. Delirium can be further categorized into subtypes (Table 48.2). The hyperactive subtype is characterized by increased motor activity, loss of control of activity, restlessness, and wandering. The hypoactive Chapter 48 • Delirium 295 subtype presents with reduction in activity, speed of actions, aware- ness of surroundings, quantity and speed of speech, and alertness. It is possible for patients to present with both hyperactive and hypoactive symptoms over the course of 24 hours, classified as having a mixed motor subtype. There has been emerging evidence of a fourth group, identified as the no motor subtype, in which they do not show charac- teristics of either hyper- or hypoactive subtypes. Although these subtypes are often seen in both pediatric and adult delirium, diagnosing delirium in children can pose challenges not present in adult populations. Developmental differences, especially in young children, necessitate alternative approaches to assessing and diagnosing delirium. Bedside staff and caregivers can provide helpful insight into behaviors and cognitive changes, such as changes in atten- tion, increased fussiness over baseline, and difficulty soothing, which might be missed by clinicians who are unable to evaluate symptoms of delirium using traditional methods (Fig. 48.1). EPIDEMIOLOGY The prevalence rate of pediatric delirium is an estimated to be 13-44% among hospitalized children, with higher rates seen in patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or those being mechani- cally ventilated. Increased risk for delirium may be associated with the underlying medical condition, prolonged hospitalization (especially ICU admission), young age, neurocognitive and developmental disor- ders, and a personal history of delirium. Potentially modifiable risk fac- tors include polypharmacy, deep sedation, the use of benzodiazepines and anticholinergic medications, disrupted sleep, pain, sensory depri- vation, and lack of familiar environment or caregivers. Delirium can occur at any age and has been observed in infants in the NICU. ETIOLOGY Although nearly any medical condition that requires hospitalization can lead to delirium, there are diagnoses that are more commonly asso- ciated with delirium (Table 48.3). Similarly, there are several drugs that are associated with the development of delirium in children includ- ing benzodiazepines, anticholinergic medications, sedatives, opiates, steroids, and some illicit substances (synthetic cathinone, synthetic cannabinoids). ASSESSMENT A thorough review of the medical record helps to identify predispos- ing and precipitating factors including exposures, changes in behavior, recent illness, and surgeries. If a reasonable cause is unable to be found on history, a further medical work-up is usually indicated. It is possible for children with known psychiatric illnesses to develop delirium in response to medical stress. Having a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis should not delay the diagnosis of delirium. Psychiatric ill- are having arom By rache us nesses that can be confused with delirium include psychosis, mania, depression, and catatonia (Table 48.4). Key factors to look for in the history of patients with delirium are an acute onset without prodrome or other previous concern for worsening behavioral functioning, vari- able symptoms from moment to moment, and deficits in attention and orientation. One of the factors that complicates assessment of delirium in chil- dren is the developmental level of the child. A young child will be unable to answer some of the standard assessment questions (eg., questions about orientation), which means that a fair amount of the assessment will come from the bedside staff and the child's primary caregivers. More standard assessment strategies can be utilized in older children and adolescents. In the patient interview, a good assessment will strive to evaluate affect, thought process, thought content, attention, and orientation to make the diagnosis of delirium. Because the nature of delirium is waxing and waning, it would not be atypical to have a seemingly normal exam in a patient one suspects to have delirium. Performing multiple assessments over the course of time is important to mak- ing an accurate diagnosis. In delirium, patients can have a disrup- tion in their normal affect and may appear restricted or dysthymic.

Chapter 48 • Delirium 297 Thought processes are often disorganized, tangential, or circum- stantial and may seem loosely associated with, or not at all related to, the reality of what is going on in the moment. Patient with delirium may also be perseverative in their thought content, with difficulty moving away from a subject or becoming highly fixated on, or pre- occupied with, one thing. They may have altered thought content, with hallucinations. Visual hallucinations especially are one of the hallmark alterations of thought content associated with delirium. Attention is frequently impacted in delirium, with patients demon- strating decreased attention, with an impaired ability to attend to a conversation or a situation. Orientation in people with delirium is often altered, especially with regards to orientation to place and time. Although all of these changes are observed to wax and wane during the course of delirium, changes in orientation can be the most striking, with patients sometimes going from being fully ori- ented to quite confused in the span of hours. RATING SCALES There are multiple rating scales that have been created to help to screen for delirium, particularly in critical care or intensive care setting (see Fig. 48.1). The Cornell Assessment for Pediatric Delirium (CAPD), Pediatric Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (pCAM-ICU), Preschool Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (psCAM-ICU), and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) are all scales that are frequently used to help monitor for delirium. The CAPD, pCAM-ICU, and psCAM-ICU have all been validated for use in the pediatric population. Rating scales are not diagnostic on their own but can be useful for identifying patients at risk for delirium and for follow- ing response to treatment. MEDICAL EVALUATION Delirium is a clinical diagnosis and can be made with history and phys- ical exam alone.

298 Part Ill • Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders the evaluation for delirium, rather clinicians should be guided by the history and medical concerns. There are times when laboratory, imag- ing, and other testing modalities can be helpful particularly in patients with suspected delirium when the underlying medical etiology of delir- jum is unknown. Central nervous system imaging may be recommended to help identify underlying processes that may be contributing to delirium; brain imaging on its own is not a tool that can diagnose delirium and is not recommended for the sole purpose of diagnosis. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the few tools that can be used to help confirm a delirium diagnosis if there is diagnos- tic ambiguity or uncertainty. Various studies have found 65-86% of children with delirium have abnormal EEGs. Findings associated with delirium typically include some degree of diffuse background slowing and disorganization. This EEG finding has been shown to effectively discriminate between children with delirium and healthy controls. However, these EEG findings are nonspecific and are not sufficient to diagnose delirium. Another caveat when utilizing EEG in the evaluation of delirium is the reality that several of the underlying causes of delirium, including metabolic derangement, seizures, infections, and intoxication, can also lead to EEG changes in the absence of delirium (see Table 48.3). DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Both medical and psychiatric disorders may share or mimic some of the symptoms of delirium and can sometimes lead to complications when trying to make the diagnosis. Catatonia, depression, and psychosis are some of the more frequently occurring diagnoses that can be confused for delirium in children and especially adolescents (see Table 48.4; see Chapter 47). In particular, catatonia can be difficult to separate from delirium, espe- cially because the two can co-occur. It is important to attempt to clarify the diagnosis because treatment of delirium and catatonia is different; the treatment for one can exacerbate the other. To help distinguish between the two, it is often helpful to assess for motor signs seen in catatonia that are not typically present in delirium (see Chapter 47.3). Additionally, catatonia is less likely to present with a waxing and waning course. The Bush-Francis Rating Scale can be used to help diagnose catatonia (see Table 47.12). Delirium can also mimic psychosis, frequently presenting with halluci- nations and sometimes delusions. One of the most profound differences between the two is the onset; delirium has an acute onset compared with the prodromal nature of a first episode of psychosis. It would be unusual for primary psychosis to develop over the course of days. However, this is characteristic of delirium. Hallucinations in delirium are often visual, whereas primary psychotic illnesses typically present with predominantly auditory hallucinations. Delusional thought content in delirium often lacks any internal structure or interconnectedness, while delusions in primary psychotic disorders are frequently structured around a common theme. Patients with depression may have some characteristics of delirium. The course and onset can help to distinguish depression from delirium; with depression the timing of onset is often closer to that of delirium. Depression does not demonstrate a waxing and waning course, and while cognition can be affected, it is often slowed with some memory problems, whereas orientation remains intact. TREATMENT Nonpharmacologic Interventions Nonpharmacologic interventions are a mainstay in both delirium treatment and prevention. The goal behind these interventions is to provide a supportive environment and to provide sensory and envi- ronmental modifications to help offset the challenges posed by the need for hospital-based care and treatment. Strategies such as frequent reorientation, adherence to normal routines, clustering care, and main- taining a normal sleep-wake cycle are all frequently implemented to prevent or manage delirium (Table 48.5) Pharmacologic Treatment Pharmacologic management of delirium focuses on both utiliz- ing medications to help manage the symptoms of delirium while the Table 48.5 Nonpharmacologic Management of Delirium Environmentall • Maintain lighting consistent with the modifications time of day • Minimize noise : Visible cobi, calendar Sensory modifications • Have appropriate sensory aides available (glasses, hearing aids) • Soft, calming music • Minimize lines, catheters, restraints • Maintain comfortable position and body alignment Caregiver interventions • Frequent reorientation • Fewer care team providers/ different faces • Cluster cares to minimize interruptions • Presence of familiar caregive schedule underlying process is being treated and removing medications that may precipitate or worsen delirium. Antipsychotics Medications for the behavioral symptoms of delirium target disruptive behaviors that pose a danger to the patient and caregivers and interfere with necessary medical care. Although these medications do not treat the underlying cause of delirium, they can help to decrease distress and lead to a shorter overall course. Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay of treatment for the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of delirium. Both first- and second-generation antipsychotics are effective, and the choice of medication is based on what other medical needs are co-occurring. It is recommended to "start low and go slow" to arrive at an effective dose. Although typically used only for a short course (days to weeks), it remains important to consider adverse effects of antipsy- chotic medications (see Chapter 33). All antipsychotics can cause QTc prolongation; thus it is recommended that electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring be considered at the onset of and throughout the treatment. For a patient who is unable to take medications by mouth, intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) haloperidol can be used. IV haloperidol is more potent than IM or oral haloperidol; switching between formulations and modes of administration must be done carefully. For patients who can take medications by mouth, second-generation antipsychotics are typi- cally the preferred choice. Risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine have all been shown to be effective in treating children and adolescents with delirium. Risperidone and olanzapine are available in an oral disintegrat- ing tablet, and quetiapine is available in a liquid solution, which makes them easy to administer for patients who are dependent on a nasogastric tube for nutrition. Choice of medication is often dependent on what is available in the treatment setting, and the preferred route of administra- tion. In chronically ill medical patients, inquiring about a past history of delirium and treatment can be helpful in guiding medication choices. Other Medications Melatonin has some utility in the management of delirium as it can help to promote a normal circadian rhythm and the return to a healthy sleep-wake cycle. Trazodone has also been shown to have some benefit for patients who are struggling with nocturnal sleep maintenance. Medications to Avoid In addition to adding medications for the treatment of delirium, elimi- nating unnecessary or potentially deliriogenic medications is equally important. Benzodiazepines worsen delirium and should be avoided as much as possible in patients at risk of developing delirium. They should not be used to treat agitation in delirious patients. Anticholinergic medications are also known to potentiate delirium and should also be avoided. Minimizing polypharmacy to the extent possible can help to 

eliminate potentially deliriogenic medications and aid in the preven- tion of delirium. Pain Medications Opiate pain medications can be associated with worsening delirium and should be used with care in patients at risk for delirium. Compli- cating this is the reality that untreated or undertreated pain can also be associated with the development and perpetuation of delirium, so ensuring adequate pain control will help to manage, and in some cases, prevent delirium. Course and Sequelae The resolution of delirium can be variable. Some patients improve quickly once the underlying cause is identified and treated, while Chapter 48 • Delirium 299 others may take weeks to months to show full resolution of symptoms. Patients who have delirium related to complex medical issues, such as autoimmune encephalitis, or prolonged hospital stays, may have longer lasting delirium. When symptoms improve, antipsychotic medications can be weaned; patients do not need to be on them long term. Sequelae Patients who have delirium are more likely to have subsequent episodes of delirium. There is evidence that patients with delirium go on to have impaired cognitive functioning compared to patients who have never had an episode of delirium.
