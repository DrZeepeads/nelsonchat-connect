Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) PART XIV Chapter 194 Evaluation of Suspected Rheumatic Disease C. Egla Rabinovich Rheumatic diseases are defined by the constellation of results of the examination, autoimmune markers and other serologic tests, tissue pathology, and imaging. Defined diagnostic criteria exist for most rheumatic diseases. Recognition of clinical patterns remains essential for diagnosis because there is no single diagnostic test, and tests may be positive in the absence of disease. Further complicating diagnosis, children sometimes present with partial criteria that evolve over time or with features of more than one rheumatic disease (over- lap syndromes). The primary mimics of rheumatic diseases are infec- tion and malignancy but also include metabolic, orthopedic, immune deficiencies, autoinflammatory diseases, and chronic pain conditions. Exclusion of possible mimicking disorders is essential before initiation of treatment for a presumptive diagnosis, especially corticosteroids. After careful evaluation has excluded nonrheumatic causes, referral to a pediatric rheumatologist for confirmation of the diagnosis and treat- ment should be considered. SYMPTOMS SUGGESTIVE OF RHEUMATIC DISEASE There are no classic symptoms of rheumatic diseases, but common symptoms include joint pain, fever, fatigue, and rash. Presenting signs and symptoms help direct the evaluation and limit unnecessary testing. Once a differential diagnosis is developed based on history and physi- cal findings, a directed assessment assists in determining the diagnosis. Arthralgias are common in childhood and are a frequent reason for referral to pediatric rheumatologists. Arthralgias without physical findings for arthritis suggest infection, malignancy, orthopedic con- ditions, benign syndromes, or pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia (Table 194.1). Although rheumatic diseases may manifest as arthral- gias, arthritis is a stronger predictor of the presence of rheumatic disease and a reason for referral to a pediatric rheumatologist. The timing of joint pain along with associated symptoms, including poor sleep and interterence with normal activities, provides important clues. Poor sleep, debilitating generalized joint pain that worsens with activ- ity, school absences, and normal physical and laboratory hndings in an adolescent suggest an amplified pain syndrome (see Chapter 212). If arthralgia is accompanied by a history of dry skin, hair loss, fatigue, growth disturbance, or cold intolerance, testing for thyroid disease is merited. Nighttime awakenings because of severe pain along with decreased platelet or white blood cell (WBC) count or, alternatively, a very high WBC count, may lead to the diagnosis of malignancy, espe- cially marrow-occupying lesions such as acute lymphocytic leukemia 1460 and neuroblastoma. Pain with physical activity suggests a mechani- cal problem such as an overuse syndrome or orthopedic condition. An adolescent presenting with knee pain aggravated by walking up stairs and on patellar distraction likely has patellofemoral syndrome. Children age 3-10 years with a history of episodic pain occurring at night, especially after increased daytime physical activity, that is relieved by rubbing but who have no limp or complaints in the morn- ing likely have growing pains. There is often a positive family history for growing pains, which may aid in this diagnosis. Intermittent pain in a child, especially a girl 3-10 years old, that is increased with activity and is associated with hyperextensible joints on examination likely has benign hypermobility syndrome. Many febrile illnesses cause arthral- gias that improve when the temperature normalizes, and arthralgias are part of the diagnostic criteria for acute rheumatic fever (ARF; see Chapter 229.1). Arthralgia may also be a presenting symptom of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and chronic childhood arthritis such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Interestingly, many children with JIA do not complain of joint symptoms at presentation. Other symp- toms more suggestive of arthritis include morning stiffness, joint swell- ing, limited range of motion, pain with joint motion, gait disturbance, fever, and fatigue or stiffness after physical inactivity (gelling phenom- enon). A diagnosis of JIA cannot be made without the finding of arthri- tis on physical examination (see Chapters 196 and 197). No laboratory test is diagnostic of JIA. Fatigue is a nonspecific symptom that may point to the presence of a rheumatic disease but is also common in nonrheumatic causes, such as viral infections, pain syndromes, depression, and malignancy. Fatigue, rather than the specific complaints of muscle weakness, is a common presenting complaint in juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). It is also frequently present in SLE, vasculitis, and chronic childhood arthritis. Overwhelming fatigue with inability to attend school is more sug- gestive of chronic fatigue syndrome, pediatric fibromyalgia, or other amplified pain syndrome. SIGNS SUGGESTIVE OF RHEUMATIC DISEASE A complete physical examination is essential in any child with sus- pected rheumatic disease, because subtle physical hindings may further refine the differential diagnosis. In addition, many rheumatic diseases have multisystem effects, and a stepped assessment should focus on delineating the extent of organ system involvement (e.g., skin, joints, muscle, hepatic, renal, cardiopulmonary). Presence of a photosensitive malar rash that spares the nasolabial folds is suggestive of SLE (Table 194.2; see Fig. 199.1A). Diffuse facial rash is more indicative of JDM. A hyperkeratotic rash on the face or around the ears may represent discoid lupus (see Fig. 199.1D). A palpable pur- puric rash on the extensor surfaces of the lower extremities points to IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) (see Fig. 210.2A). Less local- ized purpuric rashes and petechiae are present in systemic vasculitis or blood dyscrasias, including coagulopathies. Nonblanching erythematous papules on the palms are seen in vasculitis, SLE, and endocarditis. Got- tron papules (see Fig. 200.3) and heliotrope rashes (see Fig. 200.2) along with erythematous rashes on the elbows and knees are pathognomonic

Dilated capillary loops in the nail beds (periungual telangiec- tasias; see Fig. 200.4) are common in JDM, scleroderma, and second- ary Raynaud phenomenon. An evanescent macular rash associated with fever is part of the diagnostic criteria for systemic-onset arthritis (see Fig. 196.12). Sun sensitivity or photosensitive rashes are indicative of SLE or JDM but can also be caused by antibiotics. Mouth ulcers are part of the diagnostic criteria for SLE and Behçet disease (see Fig. 199.1C); painless nasal ulcers and erythematous macules on the hard palate are also common in SLE. Cartilage loss in the nose, causing a saddle nose deformity, is classically present in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener granulomatosis; see Fig. 210.8) but is also seen in relapsing polychondritis and syphi- lis. Alopecia can be associated with SLE but is also found in localized scleroderma (see Fig. 201.4) and JDM. Raynaud phenomenon may be a primary benign idiopathic disorder or can be a presenting complaint in the child with scleroderma, lupus, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), or an overlap syndrome. Diffuse lymphadenopathy is pres- ent in many rheumatic diseases, including SLE, polyarticular JIA, and systemic JIA. Irregular pupils may represent the insidious and unrec- ognized onset of uveitis associated with JIA. Erythematous conjunc- tivae may be a result of uveitis or episcleritis associated with JIA, SLE, sarcoidosis, spondyloarthropathies, or vasculitis. A pericardial rub and orthopnea are suggestive of pericarditis, often seen in systemic JIA, SLE, and sarcoid. Coronary artery dilation is strongly suggestive of Kawasaki disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) but may also be a finding in systemic arthritis and other forms of systemic vasculitis. Interstitial lung disease, suggested by dyspnea on exertion or the finding of basilar rales with decreased carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, occurs in SLE, MCTD, and systemic sclerosis. Signs consistent with pulmonary hemorrhage point to granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic angiitis, or SLE. Pulmonary vascular aneurysms are indicative of Behçet disease. Arthritis is defined by the presence of intraarticular swelling or two or more of the following findings on joint examination: pain on motion, loss of motion, erythema, and heat. Arthritis is present in all the chronic childhood arthritis syndromes, along with SLE, JDM, vasculitis, Behçet disease, sarcoidosis, Kawasaki disease, and Henoch- Schönlein purpura. Nonrheumatic causes of arthritis include malig- nancy, septic arthritis, Lyme disease, osteomyelitis, viral infections (e.g., rubella, hepatitis B, parvovirus B19, chikungunya), and postin- fectious etiologies such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), ARF, and reactive arthritis. ARF typically involves a migratory (lasting hours to days), painful arthritis. Pain on palpation of long bones is suggestive of malig- nancy. Specific muscle testing for weakness should be performed in a child presenting with fatigue or difficulty with daily tasks, because both these symptoms may be manifestations of muscle inflammation. LABORATORY TESTING There are no specific screening tests for rheumatologic disease. Once a differential diagnosis is determined, appropriate testing can be per- formed (Tables 194.3 and 194.4). Initial studies are generally performed in standard local laboratories. Screening for specific autoantibodies can be performed in commercial laboratories, but confirmation of results in a tertiary care center immunology laboratory is often necessary.

Adapted from Aggerwal A. Clinical application of tests used in rheumatology. Indian J Pediatr 2002;69:889-892. For initial workup of rheumatic disease, a CBC with differential, alanine transaminase/aspartate transaminase (ALT/AST), albumin, BUN/creatinine, urinalysis, creatine phosphokinase/lactate dehydro- genase (CPK/LDH), and inflammatory markers (sedimentation rate and CRP) are recommended. Further appropriate testing depends on clinical concern (see Table 194.4). One essential laboratory test for rheumatic disease assessment is the complete blood count (CBC), because it yields many diagnostic clues. Elevated WBC count is compatible with malignancy, infection, systemic JIA, and vasculitis. Leukopenia can be postinfectious, espe- cially viral, or caused by SLE or malignancy. Lymphopenia is more specific for SLE than is leukopenia. Platelets are acute-phase reactants and are therefore elevated with inflammatory markers. Exceptions are a bone marrow-occupying malignancy, such as leukemia or neu- roblastoma, SLE, and early Kawasaki disease. Anemia is nonspecific and may be caused by any chronic illness, but hemolytic anemia (pos- itive Coombs test result) may point to SLE or MCTD. Rheumatoid factor (RF) is present in <10% of children with JIA and thus has poor sensitivity as a diagnostic tool; RF may be elevated by infections such as endocarditis, tuberculosis, syphilis, and viruses (parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, mycoplasma), as well as primary biliary cirrhosis and malignancies. In a child with chronic arthritis, RF serves as a prognostic indicator. Inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP, fer- ritin, procalcitonin) are nonspecific and are elevated in infections, malignancies, and rheumatic diseases (Table 194.5). Their levels may also be normal in rheumatic diseases such as arthritis, sclero- derma, and dermatomyositis. The advantages of a CRP include rapid response to inflammatory stimuli, wide range of clinically relevant values, the fact that it is unaffected by age or gender, it is precise and reproducible, and it can be measured on stored sera. Sedimen- tation rates have classically been used as markers of inflammation, but they can be affected by anemia, red cell morphology, and drugs such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG); they require a fresh blood sample; and they are slow to respond to clinical changes. Inflammatory marker measurements in general are more useful in rheumatic diseases for following response to treatment than as diagnostic tests. Muscle enzymes include AST, ALT, CPK, aldolase, and LDH, any of which may be elevated in JDM and in other diseases causing muscle breakdown. Muscle-building supplements, medications, and extreme physical activity may also cause muscle breakdown and enzyme eleva- tions. AST, ALT, and aldolase may also be elevated in liver disease, and a v-glutamyltransferase (GGT) measurement may help differentiate The use of an antinuclear antibody (ANA) measurement as a screen- ing test is not recommended because it has low specificity. A positive ANA test result may be induced by infection, especially EBV infec- tion, endocarditis, and parvovirus B19 infection. The ANA test result is also positive in up to 30% of normal children, and ANA level is

In the majority of children with a positive ANA without signs of a rheumatic disease on initial evaluation, autoimmune disease does not develop over time, so this finding does not necessitate referral to a pediatric rheumatologist. A positive ANA test result is found in many rheumatic diseases, including JIA, in which it serves as a predic- tor of the risk for inflammatory eye disease (see Chapter 196). Once a positive ANA test result is discovered in a child, the need for specific autoantibody testing is directed by the presence of clinical signs and symptoms (see Table 194.3). IMAGING STUDIES Plain radiographs are useful in evaluation of arthralgias and arthritis, as they offer reassurance in benign pain syndromes and their findings may be abnormal in malignancies, osteomyelitis, and long-standing chronic juvenile arthritis. Musculoskeletal ultrasound can be useful in evaluation of synovitis and joint effusion. MRI findings are abnor- mal in inflammatory myositis and suggest the optimal site for biopsy. MRI is more sensitive than plain radiographs in detecting the presence of early erosive arthritis and demonstrates increased joint fluid, synovial enhancement, and sequela of trauma with internal joint derangement. MRI is also helpful in ruling out infection or malignancy. Cardiopul- monary evaluation is suggested for diseases commonly affecting the heart and lung, including SLE, systemic scleroderma, MCTD, JDM, and sarcoid, as clinical manifestations may be subtle. This evaluation, which may include echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, and high-resolution CT of the lungs along with consideration of bronchoal- veolar lavage, is generally performed by a pediatric rheumatologist to whom the patient is referred (see Table 194.4).

Adverse effects include elevated liver enzyme values (15%); GI toxicity (13%); stomatitis (3%); headache (1-2%); and leukope- nia, interstitial pneumonitis, rash, and alopecia (<1%). Hepatotox- icity observed among adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with MTX has raised concern about similar problems in children. Analysis of liver biopsy specimens in children with JIA undergoing long-term MTX treatment has revealed occasional mild fibrosis but no evidence of even moderate liver damage. Patients receiving MTX should be counseled to avoid alcohol, smoking, and pregnancy. Folic acid (1 mg daily) is given as an adjunct to minimize adverse effects. Lymphoproliferative disorders have been reported in adults treated with MTX, primarily in association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Regression of lymphoma may follow withdrawal of MTX. Monitoring laboratory tests for MTX toxicity include CBC and LFTs at regular intervals, initially every 8-12 weeks for the first 3-6 months of treatment, then every 12 weeks, with more frequent intervals after dosing adjustments or in response to abnormal values. Chapter 195 • Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases 1465 Hydroxychloroquine Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is an antimalarial drug important in the treat- ment of SLE and dermatomyositis, particularly cutaneous manifestations of disease and to reduce lupus flares. It is not indicated to treat JIA because of lack of efficacy. The most significant potential adverse effect is retinal toxicity, which occurs rarely but results in irreversible color blindness or loss of central vision. Complete ophthalmologic examinations, including assessment of peripheral vision and color fields, are conducted at baseline and every 6-12 months to screen for retinal toxicity. Retinal toxicity is rare (1/5,000 patients) and is associated with weight-based dosing exceed- ing 6.5 mg/kg/day; therefore recommended dosing is 5 mg/kg/day, not to exceed 400 mg/day. Other potential adverse effects include rash, skin discoloration, gastric irritation, bone marrow suppression, central nervous system (CNS) stimulation, and myositis. Leflunomide Leflunomide is a DMARD approved for treatment of RA and also offers an alternative to MTX for treatment of JIA. MTX outperformed leflunomide for treatment of JIA in a randomized trial (at 16 weeks, 89% of patients receiving MTX achieved a 30% response rate vs 68% of those receiving leflunomide), although both drugs were effective. Dosing is oral, once daily, and weight based: 10 mg for children 10 to <20 kg, 15 mg for chil- dren 20-40 kg, and 20 mg for children >40 kg. Adverse reactions include paresthesias and peripheral neuropathy, GI intolerance, elevated liver transaminases and hepatic failure, cytopenias, alopecia, and teratogenesis. Leflunomide has a long half-life, and in cases in which discontinuation of the agent is required, a drug elimination protocol with cholestyramine may be indicated. Avoidance of pregnancy is essential. Laboratory tests (e.g., CBC, LFTs) are monitored every 4 weeks for the first 6 months of treatment, then every 8-12 weeks. Sulfasalazine Sulfasalazine is used to treat children with polyarticular JIA, oligoarticu- lar JIA, and the peripheral arthritis and enthesitis associated with juvenile ankylosing spondylitis. In JIA, sulfasalazine 50 mg/kg/day (adult maxi- mum: 3,000 mg/day, divided bid) achieves greater improvement in joint inflammation, global assessment parameters, and laboratory parameters than placebo. More than 30% of sulfasalazine-treated patients withdraw from the treatment because of adverse effects, primarily GI irritation and skin rashes. Sulfasalazine is associated with severe systemic hypersensi- tivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Sulfasalazine is generally considered contraindicated in children with active systemic JIA because of increased hypersensitivity reactions. Sulfasalazine should not be used in patients with sulfa or salicylate hypersensitivity or porphyria. Monitoring laboratory tests for sulfasalazine toxicity include CBC, LFTs, serum creatinine/blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urinalysis, every other week for the first 3 months of treatment, monthly for 3 months, then every 3 months. Mycophenolate Mofetil Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive drug approved by the FDA for organ transplant rejection. MMF is used primarily for treatment of lupus, uveitis, and autoimmune skin manifestations. In adult clinical trials, MMF was noninferior to cyclophosphamide for induction therapy of lupus nephritis, with a potential for fewer adverse effects (infec- tion, gonadal toxicity). Dosing is based on body surface area (BSA): 600 mg/m - orally twice daily, with maximum dosage limits varying by for- mulation and BSA. The most common adverse reaction is GI intolerance; infections, cytopenias, and secondary malignancies are also reported. Glucocorticoids Glucocorticoids are given through oral, intravenous (IV), ocular, topi- cal, and intraarticular administration as part of treatment of rheumatic disease. Oral corticosteroids are foundational treatment for moderate to severe lupus, dermatomyositis, and most forms of vasculitis; their long-term use is associated with many well-described, dose-dependent complications, including linear growth suppression, cushingoid fea- tures, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, mood disturbance, and increased infection risk. Glucocor- ticoids should be tapered to the lowest effective dose over time and DMARDs introduced as steroid-sparing agents.

Intravenous corticosteroids have been used to treat severe, acute manifestations of systemic rheumatic diseases such as SLE, dermato- myositis, and vasculitis. The IV route allows for higher doses to obtain an immediate, profound antiinflammatory effect. Methylprednisolone 10-30 mg/kg/dose up to a maximum of 1g, given over 1 hour daily for 1-5 days is the IV preparation of choice. Although generally associ- ated with fewer adverse effects than oral corticosteroids, IV steroids are associated with significant and occasionally life-threatening toxicities, such as cardiac arrhythmia, acute hypertension, hypotension, hyper- glycemia, shock, pancreatitis, and avascular necrosis. Ocular corticosteroids are prescribed by ophthalmologists as oph- thalmologic drops or injections into the soft tissue surrounding the globe (sub-Tenon capsule injection) for active uveitis. Long-term ocular corticosteroid use leads to cataract formation and glaucoma. Current ophthalmologic management with methotrexate and biologic therapy, especially TNF inhibitors, have significantly decreased the fre- quency of eye complications of JIA-associated uveitis. Intraarticular corticosteroids are frequently used as initial therapy for children with oligoarticular JIA or as bridge therapy while await- ing efficacy of a DMARD in polyarticular disease. Most patients have significant clinical improvement within 3 days. Duration of response depends on steroid preparation used, joint affected, and arthritis sub- type; the anticipated response rate to knee injection is 60-80% at 6 months. Intraarticular administration may result in subcutaneous atrophy and hypopigmentation of the skin at the injection site, as well as subcutaneous calcifications along the needle track. JANUS KINASE INHIBITORS Another effective class of DMARDs is the Janus kinase inhibitors, col- lectively known as JAKinibs. In immune cells, these drugs inhibit intra- cellular signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway in immune cells by binding to various Janus kinases (in humans, JAK 1, JAK 2, JAK 3, and TYK2), thereby negating the response to extracellular cytokine liga- tion of immune cell receptors. Inhibition affects lymphocyte activation, function, and survival. Many JAKinibs are currently available, includ- ing tofacitinib, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, and upadacitinib. Currently, only tofacitinib has FDA approval in pediatric rheumatic disease. Tofacitinio is a small-molecule, oral JAKinib of the JAK1, JAK3, and, to a lesser extent, JAK2 enzymes. Tofacitinib has FDA approval for treatment of polyarticular JIA (age ≥2 years and weight ≥10 kg) with twice-daily dosing: 3.2 mg bid for 10-20 kg, 4 mg bid for 20-40 kg, and 5 mg bid for >40 kg. It is available as an oral solution (1 mg/mL) and as oral tablets (5 mg). Adverse reactions include increased risk of serious infections, thrombosis including pulmonary and deep venous/arterial, and gastrointestinal perforations; the most common adverse reactions are upper respiratory infections, diarrhea, and headache. Biologic Agents Biologic agents are proteins that have been engineered to target and modulate specific components of the immune system, with the goal of decreasing the inflammatory response. Antibodies have been developed to target specifc cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 or to interfere with specific immune cell function through depletion of & cells or suppres- sion of T-cell activation (Table 195.3). Biologic agents have increased the therapeutic options for treating rheumatic disease recalcitrant to nonbiologic therapies, and in some cases biologics are first-line inter- ventions. A primary concern is the increased risk of malignancy when biologics are combined with other immunosuppressants. Tumor Necrosis Factor-a Antagonists Three TNF antagonists have an FDA indication for treatment of children with moderate to severe polyarticular JIA (etanercept, adalimumab, and golimumab). Etanercept is a genetically engineered fusion protein consist- ing of two identical chains of the recombinant extracellular TNF receptor monomer fused with the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin Gy. Etan- ercept binds both TNF-a and lymphotoxin-a (formerly called TNF-ß) and inhibits their activity. Three fourths of children with active polyarticular JIA that fails to respond to MTX demonstrate response to etanercept after 3 months of therapy. Dosing is 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously weekly (max 50 mg/dose) or 0.4 mg/kg SC twice weekly (max 25 mg/dose).

Arch Dis Child Educ Pract Ed. 2009;94:151-156. is a fully human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody (mAb) used alone or in combination with MTX. In a placebo-controlled withdrawal-design study, children continuing to receive adalimumab were less likely to experience disease flares (43% vs 71%) even if they were also taking MTX (37% vs 65%). Adalimumab is administered subcutaneously every other week at a dose of 10 mg for children weighing 10 to <15 kg, 20 mg for children weighing 15 to <30 kg, and 40 mg for those weighing ≥30 kg. Golimumab is a human mAb that binds to both soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of TNF. It has FDA approval for use in polyarticular JIA at dosing of 80 mg/m? IV with initial doses at 0 and 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Non- FDA approved uses include psoriatic arthritis. Infliximab, a chimeric mouse-human mAb, was tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for use in JIA but did not achieve study end-points. However, it is FDA approved for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and has been used "off label" for treatment of polyarticular JIA, uveitis, Behçet syndrome, and sarcoidosis. Certolizumab pegol, a pegylated humanized antibody against TNF, is approved by the FDA for RA, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis in adults and is currently in pediatric trials for treatment of polyarticular JIA. The most common adverse effects are injection site reactions that diminish over time. TNF blockade is associated with an increased fre- quency of serious systemic infections, including sepsis, dissemination of latent tuberculosis (TB), and invasive fungal infections in endemic areas. TNF blockade should not be initiated in patients with a history of chronic or frequent recurrent infections. TB testing should be done before initia- tion of therapy with TNF antagonists. If test results are positive, antituber- cular treatment must be administered before anti-TNF treatment can be started. Theoretically, the risk of malignancy increases with TNF-a antago- nists. Case reports describe the development of lupus-like syndromes, leu- kocytoclastic vasculitis, interstitial lung disease, demyelinating syndromes, antibody formation to the drug, rashes, cytopenias, anaphylaxis, serum sickness, and other reactions. The benefit/risk profile appears favorable after a decade of experience with this therapeutic class; the safety of longer- term suppression of TNF function is unknown. Modulator of T-Cell Activation Abatacept is a selective inhibitor of T-cell costimulation resulting in T-cell anergy. It is FDA approved for treatment of moderate to severe polyar- ticular JIA. In a double-blind withdrawal RCT in children whose disease had not responded to DMARDs, 53% of placebo-treated patients vs 20% of abatacept-treated patients experienced disease flares during the with- drawal period. The frequency of adverse events did not differ between the 

1470 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) groups. Abatacept is administered IV every other week for three doses (<75 kg: 10 mg/kg/dose; 75-100 kg: 750 mg/dose; >100 kg: 1,000 mg/dose; maximum 1,000 mg/dose at 0, 2, and 4 weeks) and then monthly there- after. Abatacept administered by SC injection was given FDA approval in March 2017 for children ≥4 years old for treatment of polyarticular JIA at doses given weekly: 50 mg for 10-25 kg, 87.5 mg for ≥25 to <50 kg, and 125 mg for ≥50 kg. B-Cell Depletion Rituximao is a chimeric mAb to the antigen CD20, a transmembrane pro- tein on the surface of B-cell precursors and mature B lymphocytes. This antibody induces B-cell apoptosis and causes depletion of circulating and tissue-based B cells. Antibody production is not completely abrogated because plasma cells are not removed. Rituximab has FDA approval for treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in children greater than 2 years of age. It is approved for treatment of adult RA and may also have a role in treatment of SLE, particularly its hematologic manifestations. Adverse events include seri- ous infusion reactions, cytopenias, hepatitis B virus reactivation, hypo- Ta gun thy do goin gammaglobulinemia, infections, serum sickness, vasculitis, and a rare but fatal side effect, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Resistance to rituximab may develop over time in patients being treated for lymphoma. Belimumab is a human mAb to B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLys) that negatively affects B-cell proliferation, differentiation, and long-term sur- vival by inhibiting binding of BLys to its receptors on B cells. It is FDA approved for treatment of pediatric SLE in children age 5 years and older. For this indication, it is given as an IV infusion (10 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for the first three doses, then every 4 weeks thereafter. Side effects associ- ated with belimumab include increased risk of serious infections, allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions, and changes in mood. Interleukin-1 Antagonists Anakinra, a recombinant form of the human IL-1 receptor antagonist, competitively inhibits binding of IL-la and IL-1ß to the natural recep- tor, interrupting the cytokine proinflammatory cascade. Anakinra has been approved for RA in adults. In meta-analyses of treatments for RA, anakinra was outperformed by TNF-a antagonists but has a special niche in pediatric rheumatology for treatment of systemic JIA (sJIA) and other autoinflammatory syndromes, such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syn- Table 195.4 Predisposing Factors for Immunoglobulin- Induced Adverse Effects ADVERSE EFFECT Flulike symptoms PREDISPOSING FACTORS High dose, rapid infusion rate, accompanying infection, previous adverse effects Dermatologic adverse effects High dose, rapid infusion rate, accompanying infection, male patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy Arrhythmia and History of heart disease hypotension Transfusion-related acute Rapid infusion rate lung injury Thrombotic events High dose, rapid infusion rate, advanced age, being bedridden, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, prior/ current thrombosis, preexisting atherosclerotic disease, elevated serum viscosity, oral contraceptive use, hereditary hypercoagulable state, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura Aseptic meningitis Renal impairment High dose Rapid infusion rate, advanced age, renal insufficiency, nephrotic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, dehydration, sepsis paraproteinemia, nephrotoxic drugs, hemolysis, sucrose-containing preparations Hemolysis High dose, rapid infusion rate, non-O blood group, underlying inflammatory state From Guo Y, Tian X, Wang X, Xiao Z.

Adverse reactions include sig nificant injection site reactions and increased bacterial infections. Interleukin-6 Receptor Antagonist Tocilizumab is an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody binding to both soluble and membrane-associated receptors. Tocilizumab has FDA approval for treat- ment of sJIA and polyarticular JIA. Adverse reactions include transami- nase and lipid elevations. Tocilizumab is given as an IV infusion every 2 weeks (s)IA) to 4 weeks (polyarticular JIA), and SC for polyarticular JIA 162 mg every 3 weeks for those <30 kg and every 2 wk for ≥30 kg. Intravenous Immune Globulin Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is thought to be beneficial in various clinical conditions. IVIG significantly improves the short- and long-term natural history of Kawasaki disease. Open studies have sup- ported beneht for juvenile dermatomyositis, lupus-associated throm- bocytopenia, and polyarticular JIA. IVIG is given as 1-2 g/kg/dose, administered once monthly. It has been occasionally associated with severe, systemic allergy-like reactions and postinfusion aseptic menin- gitis (headache, stiff neck) (Table 195.4). Cytotoxics Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide requires metabolic conversion in the liver to its active metabolites, which alkylate the guanine in DNA, leading to immunosup- pression by inhibition of the S2 phase of mitosis. The subsequent decrease in numbers of T and B lymphocytes results in diminished humoral and cellular immune responses. Cyclophosphamide infusions (500-1,000 mg/ m-) given monthly for 6 months, then every 3 months for 12-18 months, have been shown to reduce the frequency of renal failure in patients with lupus and diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. Open trials suggest efficacy in severe CNS lupus. Oral cyclophosphamide (1-2 mg/kg/day) is effective as induction treatment of severe antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis and other forms of systemic vas- culitis, as well as interstitial lung disease or pulmonary hemorrhage associ- ated with rheumatic disease. Cyclophosphamide is a potent cytotoxic drug associated with sig- nificant toxicities. Potential short-term adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, alopecia, mucositis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and bone marrow suppression. Long-term complications include an increased risk for sterility and cancer, especially leukemia, lymphoma, and blad- der cancer. In adult women with lupus treated with IV cyclophospha- mide, 30-40% become infertile; the risk of ovarian failure appears to be significantly lower in adolescent and premenarchal girls. Ovarian suppression with an inhibitor of gonadotropin-releasing hormone to preserve fertility is currently being studied. Other Drugs Azathioprine is sometimes used to treat ANCA-associated vasculitis after induction therapy or to treat SLE. Cyclosporine has been used occasionally in the treatment of dermatomyositis on the basis of uncontrolled studies and is helpful in the treatment of macrophage activation syndrome complicating s)IA (see Chapter 207). Case reports describe the successful use of thalidomide, or its analog lenalidomide, as treatment for sJIA, inflammatory skin disorders, and Behçet disease. Several drugs commonly used in the past to treat arthritis are no lon- ger part of standard treatment, including salicylates, gold compounds, and D-penicillamine.

Chapter 196 Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Eveline Y. Wu and C. Egla Rabinovich Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease in children and one of the more common chronic illnesses of childhood. JIA represents a heterogeneous group of disorders sharing the clinical manifestation of arthritis. The etiology and pathogenesis of JIA are largely unknown, and the genetic component is complex, making clear distinction among various subtypes diffcult. As a result, several classification schemes exist, each with its own limitations. The former classification of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) uses the term juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and categorizes the disease into three onset types (Table 196.1). Attempting to standardize nomenclature, the International League of Associations for Rheu- matology (ILAR) proposed a different classification using the term juvenile idiopathic arthritis (Table 196.2), inclusive of all subtypes of chronic juvenile arthritis. We refer to the ILAR classification criteria; see Chapter 197 for enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and psoriatic JIA (Tables 196.3 and 196.4). EPIDEMIOLOGY The worldwide incidence of JIA ranges from 0.8 to 22.6 per 100,000 children per year, with prevalence ranges from 7 to 401 per 100,000. These wide-ranging numbers reflect population differences, particu- larly environmental exposure and immunogenetic susceptibility, along with variations in diagnostic criteria, difficulty in case ascer- tainment, and lack of population-based data. An estimated 300,000 U.S. children have arthritis, including 100,000 with a form of JIA. Oligoarthritis is the most common subtype (40-50%), followed by polyarthritis (25-30%) and systemic JIA (5-15%) (see Table 196.4). More females than males are affected in both oligoarticular (3:1) and polyarticular (5:1) JIA but are equally affected in systemic JIA (sJIA). The peak age at onset is 2-4 years for oligoarticular disease. Age of onset has a bimodal distribution in polyarthritis, with peaks at 2-4 years and 10-14 years. sJIA occurs throughout childhood, with a peak ETIOLOGY The etiology and pathogenesis of JIA are not completely understood, although both immunogenetic susceptibility and an external trigger are considered necessary. Twin and family studies suggest a substantial Table 196.1 Criteria for the Classification of Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis Age at onset: <16 yr Arthritis (swelling or effusion, or the presence of two or more of the following signs: limitation of range of motion, tenderness or pain on motion, increased heat) in one or more joints Duration of disease: 26 wk Onset type defined by type of articular involvement in the first 6 mo after onset: Polyarthritis: five or more inflamed joints Oligoarthritis: four or fewer inflamed joints Systemic-onset disease: arthritis with rash and a characteristic quotidian fever Exclusion of other forms of juvenile arthritis Adapted from Cassidy JT, Levison JE, Bass JC, et al. A study of classification criteria for a diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritis Rheum. 1986;29:274-281. Chapter 196 • Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 1471 role for genetic factors. JIA is a complex genetic trait in which multiple genes may affect disease susceptibility. Variants in major histocompat- ibility complex (MHC) class I and class II regions have indisputably been associated with different JIA subtypes. Non-HLA candidate loci are also associated with JIA, including polymorphisms in the genes encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22 (PTPN22), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, macrophage inhibitory factor, inter- leukin (IL)-6 and its receptor, and IL-la. Possible nongenetic triggers include bacterial and viral infections, enhanced immune responses to bacterial or mycobacterial heat shock proteins, abnormal reproductive hormone levels, and joint trauma. PATHOGENESIS JIA is an autoimmune disease associated with alterations in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. T lymphocytes have a central role, releasing proinflammatory cytokines favoring a type 1 helper T-lymphocyte response. Studies of T-cell receptor expression confirm recruitment of T lymphocytes specific for synovial non-self-antigens. B-cell activation, immune complex formation, and complement activa- tion also promote inflammation. Inheritance of specific cytokine alleles may predispose to upregulation of inflammatory networks, resulting in systemic disease or more severe articular disease. sJIA is characterized by dysregulation of the innate immune system with a lack of autoreactive T cells and autoantibodies. It therefore may be more accurately classified as an autoinflammatory disorder, which may transition to an autoimmune process once actual arthritis devel- ops (Fig. 196.1). The IL-1 family of cytokines is key to disease patho- genesis, which is strongly supported by the marked responsiveness to IL- 1 inhibitors. IL-18 in particular is a central driver, and serum IL-18 levels are markedly elevated in children with sJIA. All these immunologic abnormalities cause inflammatory synovitis, characterized pathologically by villous hypertrophy and hyperplasia with hyperemia and edema of the synovial tissue. Vascular endothelial hyperplasia is prominent and is characterized by infiltration of mono- nuclear and plasma cells with a predominance of T lymphocytes (Fig. 196.2). Advanced and uncontrolled disease leads to pannus formation and progressive erosion of articular cartilage and contiguous bone (Figs. 196.3 and 196.4). CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Arthritis must be present ≥6 weeks to make a diagnosis of any JIA subtype. Arthritis is defined by intraarticular swelling or the presence of two or more of the following signs: limitation in range of motion (ROM), tenderness or pain on motion, and warmth. Initial symptoms may be subtle or acute and often include morning stiffness with a limp or gelling after inactivity. Easy fatigabilty and poor sleep quality may be present. Involved joints are often swollen, warm to the touch, and uncomfortable on movement or palpation with reduced ROM, but usually are not erythematous. Arthritis in large joints, especially knees, initially accelerates linear growth and causes the affected limb to be longer, resulting in a discrepancy in limb lengths. Continued inflam- mation stimulates rapid and premature closure of the growth plate, resulting in shortened bones. Oligarthritis is defined as involving four or fewer joints within the first 6 months of disease onset, and often only a single joint is involved (see Table 196.4). It predominantly affects the large joints of the lower extremities, such as the knees and ankles (Fig. 196.5). Isolated involve- ment of upper-extremity large joints is less common. Those in whom disease never develops in four or more joints are regarded as having persistent oligoarticular JIA, whereas evolution of disease in five or more joints after 6 months changes the classification to extended oligoarticular JIA and is associated with a worse prognosis. Isolated involvement of the hip is almost never a presenting sign and suggests ERA (see Chapter 197) or a nonrheumatic cause. The presence of a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test confers increased risk for asymptomatic anterior uveitis, requiring periodic slit-lamp examina- tion (Table 196.5). ANA positivity may also be correlated with younger age at disease onset, females, asymmetric arthritis, and fewer involved joints over time.

Innate immune cells, such as myeloid cells (granulocytes, monocytes) and natural killer (NK) cells, are relevant during the acute febrile phase of systemic JIA. (1) Myeloid cells release interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines (IL-1ß, IL-18) and other proinflammatory cytokines, which can either be trig- gered by infection (pathogen- associated molecular patterns [PAMPs]) or result from pattern-recognition receptor activation by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from stressed or necrotic cells. (2) Together with yo T-cell receptor (yo TCR) activation by endogenous ligands (i.e., isopentenyl pyrophosphate [IPP]) or bacterial ligands, IL-1 and IL-18 can trigger IL-17 expression from yo T cells, while (3) IL-18 fails to trigger interferon-y (IFNy) expression from NK cells because of a defective IL-18 receptor (IL-18R). (4) Similarly, systemic JIA Th1 cells express only low levels of IFNy. Both cell types may contribute to hypophysiologic IFNy levels, potentially promoting IL-17 expression in disease. Although a genetic as- sociation or alterations in frequencies have been reported, the pathomechanistic roles of (5) HLA- DRB1*11 (whether antigen (Ag) presentation or intracellular function) or (6) invariant NKT (iNKT) and (7) CD4+ T cells in disease progression are yet largely unclear. Thus current data imply that in- nately adaptive immune cells bridging innate and adaptive immunity, rather than classic B or T lymphocytes, play a central role in promoting disease progression in systemic JIA. (From Kessel C, Hedrich CM, Foeil D. Innately adaptive or truly autoimmune: is there something unique about systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis? Arth Rheumatol. 2020;72:210-219, Fig. 2, p. 214) Polyarthritis is characterized by inflammation of five or more joints in both upper and lower extremities (Figs. 196.6 and 196.7). Rheu- matoid factor (RF)-positive polyarthritis resembles the characteristic symmetric presentation of adult rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules on the extensor surfaces of the elbows, spine, and over the Achilles tendons, although unusual, are associated with a more severe course and almost exclusively occur in RF-positive individuals (Fig. 196.8). Micrognathia reflects chronic temporomandibular joint

Cervical spine involvement (Fig. 196.10), mani- festing as decreased neck extension, occurs with a risk of atlantoaxial subluxation and neurologic sequelae. Hip disease may be subtle, with findings of decreased or painful ROM on examination (Fig. 196.11). Systemic JIA is characterized by arthritis (may not be evident on initial presentation), fever, rash, and prominent visceral involvement, including hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and serositis (peri- carditis). The characteristic fever, defined as spiking temperatures to ≥39°C (102.2°F), occurs on a daily or twice-daily basis for at least 2 weeks, with a rapid return to normal or subnormal temperatures (Fig 196.12). The fever is often present in the evening and is frequently accompanied by a characteristic faint, erythematous, macular rash. The evanescent salmon-colored lesions, classic for s)IA, are linear or circu- lar and are usually distributed over the trunk and proximal extremities (Fig. 196.13). The classic rash is nonpruritic and migratory with lesions lasting <1 hour. Koebner phenomenon, a cutaneous hypersensitivity in which classic lesions are brought on by superficial trauma, is often present. Heat can also evoke rash. Fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy are present in >70% of affected children. Without arthritis, the differential diagnosis includes the episodic fever (auto- inflammatory) syndromes (see Chapter 204), infection (endocarditis, rheumatic fever, brucellosis, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [MIS-C]), other rheumatic disorders (systemic lupus ery- thematosus [SLE], vasculitis syndromes, serum sickness, Kawasaki Chapter 196 • Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 1475 Fig. 196.4 MRI with gadolinium of a 10-yr-old child with juvenile idi- opathic arthritis (same patient as in Fig. 196.2).

Arthritis may affect any number of joints, but the course is classically polyarticular; may be very destructive; and can include hip, cervical spine, and temporomandibu- lar joint involvement. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS; see Chapter 207) is a rare but potentially fatal complication of sJIA that can occur at any time (onset, medication change, active or remission) during the disease course. It is also referred to as secondary hemophagocytic syndrome or hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (see Chapter 556.2). There is increasing evidence that sJIA/MAS and HLH share similar func- tional defects in granule-dependent cytotoxic lymphocyte activity. In addition, sJIA-associated MAS and HLH share genetic variants in approximately 35% of patients with sJIA/MAS. MAS classically mani- fests as acute onset of high-spiking fevers, lymphadenopathy, hepa- tosplenomegaly, and encephalopathy.

Patients may have purpura and mucosal bleeding, as well as elevated fibrin split product values and prolonged prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times. The ESR falls because of hypofibrinogenemia and hepatic dysfunction, a feature use- ful in distinguishing MAS from a flare of systemic disease (Table 196.6). An international consensus panel developed a set of classification cri- teria for sJIA-associated MAS, including hyperferritinemia (>684 ng/ mL) and any two of the following: thrombocytopenia (≤181 x 10%/L), elevated liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase >48 U/L), hypertriglyc- eridemia (>156 mg/dL), and hypofibrinogenemia (≤360 mg/dL) (see Table 196.6). These criteria apply to a febrile patient suspected of sJIA and in the absence of disorders such as immune-mediated thrombocy- topenia, infectious hepatitis, familial hypertriglyceridemia, or visceral leishmaniasis. A relative change in laboratory values is likely more rel- evant in making an early diagnosis than are absolute normal values. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may be helpful in diagnosis, but

Emergency treat- ment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, or anakinra may be effective. Severe cases may require therapy similar to that for primary HLH (see Chapter 556.2). An inflammatory lung disease has also recently been recognized as a rare but life-threatening complication in children with sJIA. Chil- dren can present with little to no respiratory symptoms; acute clubbing can be an early indicator. The predominant pathology is pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and/or endogenous lipoid pneumonia. Compared with children without lung disease, children with sJIA and lung disease are younger at diagnosis, have a history of MAS, have higher serum IL-18 levels, and have higher exposure and adverse reaction rates to cytokine inhibitors. Given the more severe disease course, lung disease in children with s)lA requires a high index of suspicion and prompt evaluation. Bone mineral metabolism and skeletal maturation are adversely affected in children with JIA, regardless of subtype. Children with JIA have decreased bone mass (osteopenia), which appears to be associated with increased disease activity. Increased levels of cytokines such as INF-a and IL-6, both key regulators in bone metabolism, have delete- rious effects on bone both within the joint and systemically in the axial Chapter 196 • Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 1477 Fig. 196.10 Radiograph of the cervical spine of a child with active juvenile idiopathic arthritis showing fusion of the neural arch between joints C2 and C3, narrowing and erosion of the remaining neural arch joints, obliteration of the apophyseal space, and loss of the normal lor- dosis.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The differential diagnosis for arthritis is broad, and a careful, thorough investigation for other underlying etiology is imperative (Table 196.7). History, physical examination, laboratory tests, and radiography may help exclude other possible causes. Arthritis can be a presenting manifestation for any of the multisystem rheumatic diseases of childhood, including SLE (see Chapter 199), juvenile dermatomyositis (see Chapter 200), sarcoidosis (see Chapter 209), and the vasculitic syndromes (see Chapter 210). In scleroderma (see Chapter 201), limited ROM caused by sclerotic skin overly- ing a joint may be confused with sequelae from chronic inflamma- tory arthritis. Acute rheumatic fever is characterized by exquisite joint pain and tenderness, remittent fever, and migratory polyar- thritis. Autoimmune hepatitis can also be associated with an acute arthritis. Many infections are associated with arthritis, and a recent history of infectious symptoms may help make a distinction. Viruses, includ- ing parvovirus B19, rubella, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV, can induce a transient arthritis. Arthritis may follow enteric infec- tions (see Chapter 198). Lyme disease should be considered in chil- dren with oligoarthritis living in or visiting endemic areas (see Chapter 268). Although a history of tick exposure, preceding flulike illness, and subsequent rash should be sought, these are not always present. Mono- articular arthritis unresponsive to antiinflammatory treatment may be the result of chronic mycobacterial or other infection, such as Kingella kingae, and the diagnosis is established by synovial fluid analysis (poly- merase chain reaction [PCR]) or biopsy. Acute onset of fever and a painful, erythematous, hot joint suggests septic arthritis (see Chapter 726). Isolated hip pain with limited ROM suggests suppurative arthri- tis, osteomyelitis (see Chapter 725), toxic synovitis, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and chondrolysis of the hip (see Chapter 719). Lower-extremity arthritis and tenderness over insertion of liga- ments and tendons, especially in a male child, suggest ERA (see Chap- ter 197). Psoriatic arthritis can manifest as limited joint involvement in an unusual distribution (eg., small joints of the hand and ankle) years before the onset of cutaneous disease. Inflammatory bowel dis- ease may manifest as oligoarthritis, usually affecting joints in the lower extremities, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms, elevations in ESR, and microcytic anemia. Many conditions present solely with arthralgia (i.e., joint pain). Hypermobility may cause joint pain, especially in the lower extrem- ities. Growing pains should be suspected in a child age 4-12 years complaining of leg pain in the evening with normal investigative studies and no morning symptoms. Nocturnal pain that awakens the child also alerts to the possibility of a malignancy. An adoles- cent with missed school days may suggest a diagnosis of fibromyal- gia (see Chapter 211.3). Children with leukemia or neuroblastoma may have joint or bone pain resulting from malignant infiltration of the bone, synovium, or more often the bone marrow, sometimes months before demonstrating lymphoblasts on peripheral blood smear. Physical examination may reveal no tenderness, a deeper pain with palpation of the bone, or pain out of proportion to exam findings. Malignant pain often awakens the child from sleep and may cause cytopenias. Because platelets are an acute-phase reactant, a high ESR with leukopenia and a low-normal platelet count may also be a clue to underlying leukemia. In addition, the characteristic quotidian fever of s)IA is absent in malignancy. Bone marrow examination is necessary for diagnosis. Some diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, and the glycogen storage diseases, have associated arthropathies. Swelling that extends beyond the joint can be a sign of lymphedema or IgA vasculitis (formerly Henoch- Schönlein purpura; see Chapter 210.1). A peripheral arthritis indis- tinguishable from JIA occurs in the humoral immunodeficiencies (see Chapter 165), such as common variable immunodeficiency and X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Skeletal dysplasias associated with a degenerative arthropathy are diagnosed from their characteristic radiologic abnormalities. Systemic onset of JIA often presents as a fever of unknown origin (see Chapter 222). Important considerations in the differential diag- nosis include infections (endocarditis, brucellosis, cat-scratch disease, Q fever, mononucleosis), autoinflammatory disease (see Chapter 204), malignancy (leukemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma), and HLH.

Inflammation may also cause eleva- tions in ESR and CRP, although it is not unusual for both to be normal in children with JIA. Elevated ANA titers are present in 40-85% of children with oligoar- ticular or polyarticular JIA but are rare with sIA. ANA seropositivity is associated with increased risk of chronic uveitis in JIA. Approxi matty is it patients wept pe articuly I wire ser, positing F more aggressive disease. Both ANA and RF seropositivity can occur in association with transient events, such as viral infection. 

1480 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) Children with sJIA usually have striking elevations in inflamma- tory markers and WBC and platelet counts. Hemoglobin levels are low, ypically 7-10 g/dL, with indices consistent with anemia of chronic disease. The ESR is usually high, except in MAS. Although immuno- globulin levels tend to be high, ANA and RF are uncommon. Ferritin values are typically elevated and can be markedly increased in MAS (>10,000 ng/mL). In the setting of MAS, all cell lines have the potential to decline precipitously because of the consumptive process. A low or normal WBC count and/or platelet count in a child with active sIA should raise concerns for MAS. Fig. 196.14 Early (6 month duration) radiographic changes of juve- nile idiopathic arthritis. Soft tissue swelling and periosteal new bone formation appear adjacent to the second and fourth proximal inter- phalangeal joints. Early radiographic changes of arthritis include soft tissue swelling, periarticular osteopenia, and periosteal new-bone apposition around affected joints (Fig. 196.14). Continued active disease may lead to subchondral erosions, loss of cartilage with varying degrees of bony destruction, and fusion. Characteristic radiographic changes in the cervical spine, most frequently in the neural arch joints at C2-C3 (see Fig. 196.10), may progress to atlantoaxial subluxation. MRI is more sensitive than radiography to detect early changes (Fig. 196.15). TREATMENT The goals of treatment are to achieve disease remission, prevent or halt joint damage, and foster normal growth and development. All chil- dren with JIA need individualized treatment plans, and management is tailored according to disease subtype and severity, presence of poor prognostic indicators, and response to medications. Disease manage- ment also requires monitoring for potential medication toxicities (see Chapter 195). Children with oligoarthritis often show partial response to non- steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with improvement in inflammation and pain (Table 196.8). Those who have no or partial response after 4-6 weeks of treatment with NSAIDs or who have func- tional limitations such as joint contracture or leg-length discrepancy benefit from injection of intraarticular corticosteroids. Triamcinolone hexacetonide is a long-lasting preparation that provides a prolonged response. A substantial fraction of patients with oligoarthritis show no response to NSAIDs and injections and therefore require treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including con- ventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) like methotrexate, and, if no response, biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) like TNF inhibitors. NSAIDs alone rarely induce remission in children with polyarthritis or sJIA. Methotrexate is the oldest and least toxic of the csDMARDs available for adjunctive therapy. It may take 6-12 weeks to see the effects of methotrexate. Failure of methotrexate monotherapy warrants the addition of a DMARD. bDMARDs that inhibit proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL-1, and IL-6, demonstrate excellent disease control. TNF-a antagonists (e.g., etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab) are used to treat children with an inadequate response to methotrex- ate, poor prognostic factors, or severe disease onset. Early aggressive therapy with a combination of methotrexate and a TNF-a antagonist may result in earlier achievement of clinically inactive disease.

TNF inhibition is not as effective for the systemic symptoms found in sJIA. When systemic symptoms dominate, systemic corticosteroids are started, followed by the initiation of IL-1 or IL-6 antagonist therapy, which often induces a dramatic and rapid response. Patients with severe disease activity may go directly to anakinra. Canakinumab, an IL-1ß inhibitor, and tocilizumab are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for slA in children older than 2 years (see Table 196.8). Stan- dardized consensus guiding therapy for sIA provide four treatment plans based on glucocorticoids, methotrexate, anakinra, or tocilizumab, with optional glucocorticoid use in the latter three plans as clinically indicated. With the use of DMARDs, the use of systemic corticosteroids can often be avoided or minimized. Systemic corticosteroids are recom- mended only for management of severe systemic illness, for bridge therapy during the wait for therapeutic response to a DMARD, and for control of uveitis. Steroids impose risks of severe toxicities, including Cushing syndrome, growth retardation, and osteopenia, and they do not prevent joint destruction. Small molecule drugs, including Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, are an alternative to cDMARDs and 6DMARDs. Oral JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib) inhibit JAK signaling pathways involved in immune activation and inflammation. Tofacitinib is FDA approved for children older than 2 years with polyarticular JIA. Management of JIA must include periodic slit-lamp ophthalmologic examinations to monitor for asymptomatic uveitis (Figs. 196.16 and 196.17; see Table 196.4). Optimal treatment of uveitis requires collabo- ration between the ophthalmologist and rheumatologist; initial man- agement may include mydriatics and corticosteroids used topically, systemically, or through periocular injection. DMARDs allow for a decrease in exposure to steroids, and methotrexate and TNF-a inhibi- tors (adalimumab and infliximab) are effective in treating severe uveitis. Dietary evaluation and counseling to ensure appropriate calcium, vitamin D, protein, and caloric intake are important for children with JIA. Physical therapy and occupational therapy are invaluable adjuncts to any treatment program. A social worker and nurse clinician can be important resources for families to recognize stresses imposed by a chronic illness, to identify appropriate community resources, and to aid compliance with the treatment protocol. PROGNOSIS Although the course of JIA in an individual child is unpredictable, some prognostic generalizations can be made on the basis of disease type and course. Studies analyzing management of JIA in the pre-TNF-a era indicate that up to 50% of JIA patients had active disease persisting into early adulthood, often with severe limitations of physical function. Children with persistent oligoarticular disease fare well, with a majority achieving disease remission. Those with extended oligoarticular disease have a poorer prognosis. Children with oligoarthritis, particularly females who are ANA positive and with onset of arthritis before 6 years of age, are at greatest risk for development of chronic uveitis. There is no association between the activity or severity of arthritis and uveitis. Persistent, uncontrolled anterior uveitis (see Fig. 196.16) can cause posterior synechiae, cataracts, glaucoma, and band keratopathy, with resultant blindness. Morbidity can be averted with early diagnosis and implementation of systemic therapy. The child with polyarticular JIA often has a more prolonged course of active joint inflammation and requires early and aggressive therapy. Predictors of severe and persistent disease include young age at onset, RF seropositivity or rheumatoid nodules, presence of anti-cyclic citrul- linated peptide antibodies, and many affected joints. Disease involving the hip and hand/wrist is also associated with a poorer prognosis and may lead to significant functional impairment. sJIA is often the most difficult to control in terms of both articular inflam- mation and systemic manifestations. Poorer prognosis is related to poly- articular distribution of arthritis, fever lasting >3 months, and increased inflammatory markers, such as platelet count and ESR, for >6 months. IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors have changed the management and improved the out- comes for children with severe and prolonged systemic disease. Orthopedic complications include leg-length discrepancy and flexion contractures, particularly of the knees, hips, and wrists.

Joint contractures require aggressive medical control of arthritis, often in conjunction with intraarticular cortico- steroid injections, appropriate splinting, and stretching of the affected tendons. Popliteal cysts may require no treatment if they are small or respond to intraarticular corticosteroids in the anterior knee. Psychosocial adaptation may be affected by JIA. Studies indicate that, compared with controls, a significant number of children with JIA have problems with lifetime adjustment and employment. Disability not directly associated with arthritis may continue into young adult- hood in as many as 20% of patients, together with continuing chronic pain syndromes at a similar frequency. Psychological complications, including problems with school attendance and socialization, may respond to counseling by mental health professionals.

Chapter 197 Ankylosing Spondylitis and Other Spondyloarthritides Pamela F. Weiss The diseases collectively referred to as spondyloarthritides include ankylosing spondylitis (AS), arthritis associated with inflamma- tory bowel disease (IBD) or psoriasis, and reactive arthritis after gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) infections (Table 197.1 and Table 197.2). Spondyloarthritis is more common in adults, but all forms can present during childhood with varying symptoms and signs. Many children with spondyloarthritis are classified in the juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) categories of enthesitis- related arthritis (ERA) or psoriatic arthritis. Children and adoles- cents with spondyloarthritis who may not meet JIA criteria include arthritis associated with IBD, juvenile ankylosing spondylitis (JAS), and reactive arthritis. EPIDEMIOLOGY JIA is diagnosed in 90 per 100,000 U.S. children every year (see Chapter 196). ERA accounts for 10-20% of JIA and has a mean age at onset of 12 years. In India, ERA is the most common category of JIA, accounting for 35% of cases. Unlike other JIA categories, males are affected more often than females, accounting for 60% of ERA cases. AS occurs in 0.2-0.5% of adults, with approximately 15% of cases beginning in childhood. These disorders can be famil- ial, largely as a result of the influence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -B27, which is found in 90% of JAS and 50% of ERA patients compared to 7% of healthy individuals. Approximately 20% of chil- dren with ERA have a family history of HLA-B27-associated dis- ease, such as reactive arthritis, AS, or IBD with sacroiliitis. Chapter 197 • Ankylosing Spondylitis and Other Spondyloarthritides 1483 ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS Spondyloarthritides are complex diseases in which susceptibility is largely genetically determined. Only 30% of heritability has been defined, with HLA-B27 responsible for two thirds of the total, and >100 additional genetic loci accounting for only one third. Genes that infie, se inter lend he in po 2 ARD) e particularly important. Unusual properties of HLA-B27, such as its tendency to misfold and form abnormal cell surface structures, may have a role. Infection with certain GI or GU pathogens can trigger reactive arthri- tis (see Table 197.2 and Chapter 198). Altered gut microbiota and an abnormal immune response to normal microbiota may also play a role in pathogenesis. Inflamed joints and entheses in spondyloarthritis con- tain T and B cells, macrophages, osteoclasts, proliferating fibroblasts, and osteoblasts, with activation of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway. Bone loss and osteoproliteration in and around vertebral bodies and facet joints in long-standing AS contribute to significant morbidity. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS Clinical manifestations that help distinguish spondyloarthritis from other forms of juvenile arthritis include arthritis of the axial skeleton (sacroiliac joints or spine) and hips, enthesitis (inflamma- tion at the site of a tendon, ligament, or joint capsule attachment to bone), symptomatic eye inflammation (acute anterior uveitis), and GI inflammation (even in the absence of IBD) (Table 197.3, but see also Table 197.1). Enthesitis-Related Arthritis Children fulfill classification criteria for ERA if they have either arthritis and enthesitis or arthritis or enthesitis with at least two of the following characteristics: (1) sacroiliac joint tenderness or inflammatory lumbosacral pain, (2) presence of HLA-B27, (3) onset of arthritis in a male older than 6 years, (4) acute anterior uveitis, and (5) a family history of an HLA-B27-associated disease (ERA, sacroiliitis with IBD, reactive arthritis, or acute anterior uveitis) in a first-degree relative. Patients with psoriasis (or a family his- tory of psoriasis in a first-degree relative), a positive-rheumatoid factor (RF) test result, or systemic arthritis are excluded from this group. During the first 6 months of disease the arthritis is typically Table 197.1 Overlapping Characteristics of the Spondyloarthritides* CHARACTERISTIC Enthesitis Axial arthritis JUVENILE ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS +++ +++ JUVENILE PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS Peripheral arthritis HLA-B27 positive Antinuclear antibody positive Rheumatoid factor positive SYSTEMIC DISEASE Eyes Skin Mucous membranes Gastrointestinal tract +++ +++| - + - - ++ +++ + ++ - + +++ *Frequency of characteristics: -, absent; +, <25%; ++, 25-50%; +++, 50-75%; ++++, ≥75%.

Inflammation of the small joints of the foot, or tarsitis, is highly suggestive of ERA. Enthesitis is typically sym- metric and affects the lower limbs. Up to 40% of children develop clinical or radiographic evidence of sacroiliac joint arthritis as part of their disease; approximately 20% have evidence of sacroiliac joint arthritis at diagnosis. When the sacroiliac or other axial joints are involved, children may experience inflammatory back pain (Table 197.4), hip pain, and alternating buttock pain. Patients may also experience pain with palpation of the lower back or with pelvic compression. The risk of sacroiliac joint arthritis is highest in chil- dren who are HLA-B27 positive and have an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Untreated sacroiliitis may, but does not always, evolve into AS; additional risk factors for progression are unclear. Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis accounts for approximately 5% of JIA. Common clinical features of psoriatic arthritis are nail pitting (Fig. 197.1), ony- cholysis, and dactylitis (sausage-like swelling of fingers or toes). Children fulfill classification criteria for psoriatic arthritis if they have arthritis and psoriasis or arthritis and at least two of the follow- ing: (1) dactylitis, (2) nail pitting or onycholysis, and (3) psoriasis in a first-degree relative. The presence of psoriasis aids in diagnosis but is not required. Disease onset peaks during the preschool and early adolescent years. Children with onset during the preschool years are more often female, antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive, and at risk for asymptomatic ocular inflammation. Disease onset during adoles- cence is equally common among males and females. In the majority

Rheum Dis Clin N Am. 2021;47:565-583, Table 1, p. 567. of children, the arthritis is asymmetric and affects four or fewer joints at presentation. Large (knees and ankles) and small (fingers and toes) joints may be involved. Although distal interphalangeal joint involve- ment is uncommon, it is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Enthesitis is detectable in ~20-75% of patients and seems to be more frequent in those who present at an older age (lable 197.5, Fig. 197.2). Axial (sacroiliac) and root (hip) joints may be affected in up to 30% of chil- dren; the risk of axial arthritis is highest in those who are HLA-B27 positive. Juvenile Ankylosing Spondylitis JAS frequently begins with oligoarthritis and enthesitis. The arthri- tis occurs predominantly in the lower extremities and often involves the hips. In comparison to adult-onset AS, axial disease and inflammatory back pain are less frequent at disease onset, whereas enthesitis and peripheral arthritis are more common. AS is diag- nosed according to the modified New York (NY) criteria if there is sufficient radiographic evidence of sacroiliitis (sacroiliitis of grade 2 or greater bilaterally or at least grade 3 unilaterally) and if the patient meets at least one clinical criterion involving inflammatory back pain, limitation of motion in the lumbar spine (Fig. 197.3), or limitation of chest expansion. JAS is present if the patient is <16 years old. Juvenile-onset AS is frequently used to describe adult AS when the symptoms began before 16 years of age but full criteria were not met until later. To fulfill the modified NY criteria for AS, patients must have radiographic changes in the sacroiliac joints and clinical sequelae of axial disease. Because radiographic sacroiliitis can take many years to develop in adults and even longer in children, and clini- cal sequelae may lag further behind, criteria to identify preradio- graphic axial spondyloarthritis were developed by the Assessment of Spondylo Arthritis International Society. To meet criteria for axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), patients must have at least 3 months of back pain and sacroiliitis on imaging (acute inflammation on MRI or definite radiographic sacroiliitis by NY criteria) plus one feature of SpA (inflammatory back pain, arthritis, enthesitis [heel], uveitis, dactylitis, psoriasis, Crohn disease/ulcerative colitis, good response to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], family history for SpA, HLA-B27, or elevated CRP). Alternatively, patients can fulfill axial SpA criteria if they are HLA-B27 positive and have at least two SpA features. These criteria have low sensitivity and specificity in the pediatric population but, in the absence of alterna- tive pediatric criteria, may be useful as a guide to evaluating prera- diographic axial SpA. Arthritis with Inflammatory Bowel Disease The presence of erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, oral ulcers, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, weight loss, or anorexia in a child with chronic arthritis should raise suspicion of IBD. Two patterns of arthritis complicate IBD. Polyarthritis affecting large and small joints is most common and often reflects the activity of the intestinal inflammation. Less frequently, arthritis of the axial skeleton, includ- ing the sacroiliac joints, occurs. As with psoriatic arthritis, the presence of HLA-B27 is a risk factor for the development of axial disease. The severity of axial involvement is independent of the activity of the GI inflammation. LABORATORY FINDINGS Laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation with elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or CRP value is vari- able in most spondyloarthritides and may or may not be present at the onset of disease. RF and ANAs are absent, except in chil- dren with psoriatic arthritis, as many as 50% of whom are ANA positive. HLA-B27 is present in approximately 90% of children with TAS, compared with 7% of healthy individuals, but is less frequent in ERA and other SpA types. Imaging Conventional radiographs detect chronic bony changes and damage but not active inflammation and are unreliable in the assessment of pediatric disease. Early radiographic changes in the sacroiliac joints include indistinct margins and erosions. Sclerosis typically starts on the iliac side of the joint (Fig. 197.4). Peripheral joints may exhibit periarticular osteoporosis, with loss of sharp cortical mar- gins in areas of enthesitis, which may eventually show erosions or bony spurs (enthesophytes). Squaring of the corners of the vertebral bodies and syndesmophyte formation resulting in the classic "bam- boo spine" characteristic of advanced AS are rare in early disease, particularly in childhood. CT, like radiographs, can detect chronic bony changes but not active inflammation and has the disadvantage of more radiation exposure. The gold standard for early visualiza- tion of sacroiliitis is evidence of bone marrow edema adjacent to the joint on MRI with fluid-sensitive sequences such as short-T1 inversion recovery (STIR) (Figs. 197.5 and 197.6). Gadolinium does not add value to the study of the sacroiliac joints if STIR is used. MRI will reveal abnormalities before the plain radiograph. Whole

The lower spine remains straight when the patient bends forward. body MRI may also be used to evaluate the axial skeleton in adults with early disease because it can detect vertebral lesions in addition to sacroiliac changes. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The onset of arthritis after a recent history of diarrhea or symptoms of urethritis or conjunctivitis may suggest reactive arthritis (see Chapter 198). Lower back pain can be caused by strain, infectious arthritis of the sacroiliac joint, osteomyelitis of the pelvis or spine, chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) of the pelvis or spine, osteoid osteoma of the posterior elements of the spine, pelvic muscle pyomyositis, or malignancies. In addition, mechanical conditions such as spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, and Scheuermann disease should be considered. Back pain secondary to fibromyalgia usually affects the soft tissues of the upper back in a symmetric pattern and is associated with well-localized tender points and sleep distur- bance (see Chapter 211.3). Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (avascular necrosis of the femoral head), slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and chondrolysis may also manifest as pain over the inguinal ligament and loss of internal rotation of the hip joint, but without other SpA features, such as involvement of other entheses and/or joints. Radi- ography and MRI are critical for distinguishing these conditions.

Fluid and pathology appear bright, spinal fluid also appears bright. Increased signal abnormality is observed around bilateral triradiate cartilages and greater trochanteric apophyses (arrow- heads), common areas of involvement for ERA. Also, signal abnormality appears on the iliac side of the sacroiliac joints bilaterally around more curvilinear, dark, sclerotic subchondral areas representing erosions and sacroiliitis (arrows). (From Tse SM, Laxer RM. New advances in juvenile spondyloarthritis. Nat Rev Rheumatol. 2012;10;8:269-279.) TREATMENT The goals of therapy are to control inflammation, minimize pain, preserve function, and prevent ankylosis (fusion of adjacent bones) using a combination of antiinflammatory medications, physical therapy, and education. Treatment regimens for SpA include mono- therapy or combination therapy with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or biologic agents. NSAIDs, such as naproxen (15-20 mg/kg/day), are frequently used to help relieve symptoms and may slow the progression of structural damage (syndesmophyte formation and growth) if used continually. With relatively mild monoarticular disease, intraarticular corticosteroids (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide/hexacetonide) may also help to con- trol peripheral joint inflammation. DMARDs such as sulfasalazine (up to 50 mg/kg/day; maximum 3 g/day) or methotrexate (10 mg/ mª) may be beneficial for peripheral arthritis, but these medications have not been shown to improve axial disease in adults. For axial arthritis, it is typically necessary to add a biologic therapy. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (e.g., etanercept, infliximab, adali- mumab) have been efficacious in reducing symptoms and improv- ing function in adults with AS. It remains unclear whether TNF inhibitors have an impact on structural damage in established AS, underscoring the need for earlier recognition and better therapies. Drugs that target IL-17 (secukinumab/ixekizumab), IL-23/IL-12 Fig. 197.6 Short T1 inversion recovery image from whole body MRI of a 15-yr-old boy with HLA-B27-negative JSpA.

(ustekinumab), and the JAK/STAT pathway (tofacitinib/upadaci- tinib) reduce clinical disease activity in adults with AS. Physical therapy and low-impact exercise should be included in the treatment program for all children with spondyloarthritis. Exercise to maintain range of motion in the back, thorax, and affected joints should be instituted early in the disease course. Custom-fitted insoles and heel cups are particularly useful in the management of painful entheses around the feet, and the use of pillows to position the lower extremities while the child is in bed can be helpful. PROGNOSIS Years ation it spend yogre is pogoin disease. Divis fer -5- sion occurs in <20% of children with spondyloarthritis 5 years after diagnosis. Factors associated with disease progression include tarsitis, HLA-B27 positivity, hip arthritis within the first 6 months, and dis- ease onset after age 8. Important questions, such as which patients with ERA will go on to have JAS/AS, have yet to be addressed.

1488 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) Chapter 198 Reactive and Postinfectious Arthritis Pamela F. Weiss is relatively uncommon in children. The arthritis is typically asymmet- ric and oligoarticular, with a predilection for the lower extremities. Dactylitis may occur, and enthesitis is common, affecting as many as 90% of patients (Fig. 198.1). Cutaneous manifestations can occur and may include circinate balanitis, ulcerative vulvitis, erythematous oral macules or plaques or erosions, erythema nodosum, paronychia, pain- ful erosions or pustules on fingertips, and keratoderma blennorrhag- ica, which is similar in appearance to pustular psoriasis (Fig. 198.2). Systemic symptoms may include fever, malaise, and fatigue. Less com- mon features may include conjunctivitis, optic neuritis, aortic valve involvement, sterile pyuria, and polyneuropathy. Early in the disease course, markers of inflammation-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, and platelets— may be greatly elevated. The clinical manifestations may last for weeks to months. Familiarity with other causes of postinfectious arthritis is vital when a diagnosis of reactive arthritis is being considered. Numerous viruses are associated with postinfectious arthritis and may result in particu- lar patterns of joint involvement (Table 198.1). Rubella and hepatitis B virus typically affect the small joints, whereas mumps and varicella often involve large joints, especially the knees. Hepatitis B arthritis- dermatitis syndrome is characterized by urticarial rash and a sym- metric migratory polyarthritis resembling that of serum sickness. Rubella-associated arthropathy may follow natural rubella infection and, infrequently, rubella immunization. It typically occurs in young women, with an increased frequency with advancing age, and is uncommon in preadolescent children and in males. Arthralgia of the knees and hands usually begins within 7 days of onset of the rash or 10- 28 days after immunization. Parvovirus B19, which is responsible for erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), can cause arthralgia, symmetric In addition to causing arthritis by means of direct microbial infec- tion (i.e., septic arthritis; see Chapter 726), microbes activate innate and adaptive immune responses, which can lead to the generation and deposition of immune complexes and antibody or T-cell-medi- ated cross-reactivity with self. Furthermore, microbes may influence the immune system in ways that promote immune-mediated inflam- matory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflam- matory bowel disease (IBD), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and spondyloarthritis. Reactive arthritis and postinfectious arthritis are defined as joint inflammation caused by a sterile inflammatory reac- tion after a recent infection. The term reactive arthritis is used to refer to arthritis that occurs after enteropathic or urogenital infections and postinfectious arthritis to describe arthritis that occurs after infectious illnesses not classically considered in the reactive arthritis group, such as infection with group A streptococcus or viruses. In some patients, nonviable components of the initiating organism have been demon- strated in affected joints, and the presence of viable, yet nonculturable, bacteria within the joint remains an area of investigation. The course of reactive arthritis is variable and may remit or progress to a chronic spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (see Chapter 197). In postinfectious arthritis, the pain or joint swelling is usually transient, lasting <6 weeks, and does not necessarily share the typical spondyloarthritis pattern of joint involvement. The distinction between postinfectious arthritis and reactive arthritis is not always clear, either clinically or pathophysiologically. PATHOGENESIS Reactive arthritis typically follows enteric infection with Salmonella species, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, or genitourinary (GU) tract infection with Chlamydia trachoma- tis. Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile are also causative enteric agents, although less common (see Table 197.2). Acute rheumatic fever caused by group A streptococcus (see Chapters 229 and 229.1), arthritis associated with infective endocarditis (see Chapter 486), and the tenosynovitis associated with Neisseria gonorrhoeae are similar in some respects to reactive arthritis. Approximately 75% of patients with reactive arthritis are HLA-B27 positive. Incomplete elimination of bacteria and bacterial products, such as DNA, has been proposed as a factor in reactive arthritis. A relation- ship with clinical characteristics of specific infectious disorders is not present. In postinfectious arthritis, several viruses (rubella, varicella- zoster, herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus) have been isolated from the joints of patients. Antigens from other viruses (e.g., hepatitis B, adeno- virus) have been identified in immune complexes from joint tissue. Patients with reactive arthritis who are HLA-B27 positive have an increased frequency of acute and symptomatic uveitis and other extraarticular features. In addition, HLA-B27 is a risk factor for per- sistent gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation after enteric infections, even after resolution of the initial infection, and significantly increases the risk that the individual will develop chronic spondyloarthritis. Nev- ertheless, reactive arthritis also occurs in HLA-B27-negative patients, emphasizing the importance of other genes in disease susceptibility. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Symptoms of reactive arthritis begin approximately 3 days to 6 weeks after infection.

Arthritis occurs occasionally during cyto- megalovirus infection and may occur during varicella infections but is rare after Epstein-Barr virus infection. Varicella may also be com- plicated by suppurative arthritis, usually secondary to group A strep- tococcus infection. HIV is associated with an arthritis that resembles psoriatic arthritis more than JIA (see Chapter 196). Poststreptococcal arthritis may follow infection with either group A or group G streptococcus. It is typically oligoarticular, affecting lower-extremity joints, and mild symptoms can persist for months. Poststreptococcal arthritis differs from rheumatic fever, which typi- cally manifests with painful migratory polyarthritis of brief duration. Because valvular lesions have occasionally been documented by echo- cardiography after the acute illness, some clinicians consider post- streptococcal arthritis to be an incomplete form of acute rheumatic fever (see Chapter 229.1). Certain HLA-DRB1 types may predispose children to development of either poststreptococcal arthritis (HLA- DRB1*01) or acute rheumatic fever (HLA-DRB1*16). Transient synovitis (toxic synovitis), another form of postinfec- tious arthritis, typically affects the hip, often after an upper respiratory tract infection (see Chapter 719.2). Males 3-10 years of age are most often affected and have acute onset of severe pain in the hip (groin), with referred pain to the thigh or knee, lasting approximately 1 week. ESR and white blood cell count are usually normal. Radiologic or ultra- sound examination may confirm widening of the joint space secondary to an effusion. Aspiration of joint fluid is often necessary to exclude septic arthritis and typically results in dramatic clinical improvement. The trigger is presumed to be viral, although responsible microbes have not been identified. Nonsuppurative arthritis has been reported in children, usually adolescent males, in association with severe truncal acne. Patients often have fever and persistent infection of the pustular lesions. Pyo- genic (sterile) arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (cystic) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a pathogenic variant in the PSTPIPl gene, is a difficult-to-treat but rare autoin- flammatory disorder that has responded to anakinra or anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody therapy in a few patients (see Chapter 710). Recurrent episodes of erosive arthritis begin in childhood; cystic acne and the painful ulcerating lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum begin during adolescence. Recurrent episodes may also be associated with a sterile myopathy and may last for several months. Infective endocarditis can be associated with arthralgia, arthritis, or signs suggestive of vasculitis, such as Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, Chapter 198 • Reactive and Postinfectious Arthritis 1489 and Roth spots. Postinfectious arthritis, perhaps because of immune complexes, also occurs in children with N. gonorrhoeae, Neisseria men- ingitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. DIAGNOSIS A recent GU or GI infection may suggest the diagnosis of reactive arthritis, but there is no diagnostic test. A complete blood count, acute-phase reactants, complete metabolic panel, and urinalysis may be helpful to exclude other etiologies. Although stool or urogenital tract cultures can be performed in an attempt to isolate it, the trig- gering organism is not typically found at the time arthritis presents. Imaging findings are nonspecific or normal. Documenting previous streptococcal infection with antibody testing (anti-streptolysin 0 and anti-DNAse B) may help to diagnose postinfectious arthritis. Serum sickness associated with the antibiotic treatment of preceding infection Because the preceding infection can be remote or mild and often not recalled by the patient, it is also important to rule out other causes of arthritis. Acute and painful arthritis affecting a single joint suggests septic arthritis, mandating joint aspiration. Osteomyelitis may cause pain and an effusion in an adjacent joint but is more often associated with focal bone pain and tenderness at the site of infection. Arthritis affecting a single joint, particularly the knee, may also be secondary to Lyme disease in endemic areas. The diagnosis of postinfectious arthri- tis is often established by exclusion and after the arthritis has resolved. Arthritis associated with GI symptoms or abnormal liver function test results may be triggered by infectious or autoimmune hepatitis. Arthritis or spondyloarthritis may occur in children with IBD, such as Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis (see Chapters 382.1 and 382.2). Parvovirus infection, macrophage activation (hemophagocytic) syn- drome, and leukemia should be strongly considered when two or more blood cell lines are low or progressively decrease in a child with arthritis. Persistent arthritis (>6 weeks) suggests the possibility of a chronic rheumatic disease, including JIA (see Chapter 196) and SLE (see Chapter 199). TREATMENT Specific treatment is unnecessary for most cases of reactive or postin- fectious arthritis. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often needed for management of pain and functional limitation. Unless ongoing Chlamydia infection is suspected, attempts to treat the offending organism are not warranted. If swelling or arthralgia recurs, further evaluation may be necessary to exclude active infection or evolving rheumatic disease. Intraarticular corticosteroid injections may be given for refractory or severely involved joints once acute infec- tion has been ruled out. Systemic corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are rarely indicated but may be con- sidered for chronic disease. Participation in physical activity should be encouraged, and physical therapy may be needed to maintain nor- mal function and prevent muscle atrophy. For postinfectious arthri- tis caused by streptococcal disease, current recommendations include penicillin prophylaxis for at least 1 year. Long-term prophylaxis is often recommended, but the duration is controversial and may need to be individualized. COMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS Postinfectious arthritis after viral infections usually resolves without complications unless it is associated with involvement of other organs, such as encephalomyelitis. Children with reactive arthritis after enteric infections occasionally experience IBD months to years after onset. Both uveitis and carditis have been reported in children diag- nosed with reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis, especially after bacte- rial enteric infection or GU tract infection with C. trachomatis, has the potential for evolving to chronic arthritis, particularly spondyloarthri- tis (see Chapter 197). The presence of HLA-B27 or significant systemic features increases the risk of chronic disease. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. 

1490 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) Chapter 199 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Rebecca E. Sadun and Stacy P. Ardoin return to near-prepubertal ratios in the postmenopausal period. Childhood SLE is rare before 5 years of age and is usually diagnosed in adolescence, with a median age at diagnosis of 11-12 years. Up to 20% of all individuals with SLE are diagnosed before age 16 years. Pediatric-onset SLE (pSLE) is defined as onset of symptoms before age 16 or 18 years. PATHOLOGY Histologic features most suggestive of SLE include findings in the kidney and skin. Renal manifestations of SLE are classified histo- logically according to the criteria of the International Society of Nephrology (see Chapter 560.2). The finding of diffuse prolifera- tive glomerulonephritis (class IV) significantly increases the risk Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by multisystem inflammation and the pres- ence of circulating autoantibodies directed against self-antigens. at in pen. SLE occurs in both children and adults, disproportionately affect- ing females of reproductive age. Although nearly every organ may be affected, most commonly involved are the skin, joints, kidneys, blood-forming cells, blood vessels, and the central nervous system. Systemic signs of inflammation such as fever and lymphadenopathy can also be seen. Compared with adults, children and adolescents with SLE have more severe disease and more widespread organ involvement. ETIOLOGY The pathogenesis of SLE remains largely unknown, but several factors likely influence risk and severity of disease, including genetics, hor- monal milieu, and environmental exposures. A genetic predisposition to SLE is suggested by the association with specific genetic variants, including congenital deficiencies of C1q, C2, and C4, as well as several polymorphisms (e.g., interferon regulatory factor 5 and protein tyrosine phosphatase N22) and familial clustering of SLE or other autoimmune disease (Table 199.1). In addition, cer- tain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types (including HLA-B8, HLA- DR2, and HLA-DR3) occur with increased frequency in patients with SLE. Although SLE clearly has a genetic component, its occurrence is sporadic in families and its concordance is incomplete (estimated at 2-5% among dizygotic twins and 25-60% among monozygotic twins), suggesting nonmendelian genetics and involvement of epigenetic and environmental factors. Patients with SLE often have family members- especially mothers and sisters—with SLE or various other autoimmune Because SLE preferentially affects females, especially during their reproductive years, it is suspected that hormonal factors are impor- tant in pathogenesis. Of individuals with SLE, 90% are female, making temale sex the strongest risk factor for SLE. Estrogens are likely to play a role in SLE, and both in vitro and animal model studies suggest that estrogen exposure promotes B-cell autoreactivity. Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives do not appear to induce flares in quiescent SLE, though the risk of flares may be increased in postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement. Environmental exposures that may trigger the development of SLE remain largely unknown; certain viral infections (including Epstein-Barr virus) may play a role in susceptible individuals, and ultraviolet light exposure is known to trigger SLE disease activity. Environmental influences also may induce epigenetic modifica- tions to DNA, increasing the risk of SLE and drug-induced lupus; in mouse models, drugs such as procainamide and hydralazine can promote lymphocyte hypomethylation, causing a lupus-like syndrome. EPIDEMIOLOGY The reported prevalence of SLE in children and adolescents (1- 6/100,000) is lower than that in adults (20-70/100,000). Prevalence of SLE is highest among patients of African, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific Island ancestry for both adult and pediatric populations. SLE predominantly affects females, with a reported 2-5:1 ratio before puberty, 9:1 ratio during reproductive years, and found with "full house" deposition of immunoglobulin and comple- ment. The characteristic discoid rash depicted in Figure 199.1D is characterized on biopsy by hyperkeratosis, follicular plugging, and infiltration of mononuclear cells into the dermal-epidermal junc- tion. The histopathology of photosensitive rashes can be nonspe- cific, but immunofluorescence examination of both affected and nonaffected skin may reveal deposition of immune complexes within the dermal-epidermal junction. This finding is called the lupus band test, which is specific for SLE. PATHOGENESIS A hallmark of SLE is the generation of autoantibodies directed against self-antigens, particularly nucleic acids. These intracellular antigens are ubiquitously expressed but are usually inaccessible and cloistered within the cell. During cell necrosis or apoptosis, the anti- gens are released. SLE skin cells are highly susceptible to damage from ultraviolet light, and the resulting cell death leads to release of cell contents, including nucleic antigens. Individuals with SLE may have impaired apoptosis or impaired ability to clear cell debris, causing prolonged exposure to nucleic antigens in the bloodstream and increased opportunity for recognition by immune cells, lead- ing to B-cell stimulation and autoantibody production. Circulating autoantibodies form immune complexes and deposit in tissues, lead- ing to local complement activation, initiation of a proinflammatory cascade, and, ultimately, tissue damage. Antibodies to double- stranded DNA (dsDNA) can form immune complexes, deposit in glomeruli, and initiate inflammation leading to glomerulonephritis. However, many individuals with SLE have circulating antibodies to dsDNA yet do not have nephritis, suggesting that autoantibodies are not the only pathway leading to end-organ damage in SLE. Both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system have been implicated in the dysregulation of the immune system seen in SLE. High levels of interferon-a production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells promote expression of other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, maturation of monocytes into myeloid dendritic cells, promotion of autoreactive B and T cells, and loss of self-tolerance. Nearly 85% of patients with SLE exhibit this cytokine profile, known as the type I interferon signature. Other cytokines with increased expression in SLE include interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL- 12, IL-17, and IL-21; anti-tumor necrosis factor-a; interferon-y; and B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), also known as B-cell-activating fac- tor (BAFF). Both B and T cells demonstrate functional impairments in SLE. In active SLE, B-cell populations have impaired tolerance and increased autoreactivity, enhancing B cells' ability to produce auto- antibodies after exposure to self-antigen. In addition, cytokines such as BLyS/BAFF may promote abnormal B-cell number and function. T-cell abnormalities in SLE include increased numbers of memory T cells and decreased number and function of T-regulatory cells. SLE T cells display aberrant signaling and increased autoreactivity. As a result, they are resistant to attrition by normal apoptosis pathways. In addition, a neutrophil signature can be identified in 65% of adult SLE patients and has recently been recognized as a potential biomarker for active lupus nephritis.

In Cassidy JT, Petty RE, Laxer RM, et al., eds. Textbook of Pediatric Rheumatology, 6th ed. Philadel- phia: Saunders; 2011: Fig. 21-17, p. 329.) CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Any organ system can be involved in SLE, so the potential clinical mani- festations are myriad (Table 199.2). The presentation of SLE in childhood or adolescence differs somewhat from that seen in adults. The most com- mon presenting complaints of children with SLE include fever, fatigue, hematologic abnormalities, arthralgia, and arthritis. Arthritis is usually present in the first year of diagnosis; arthritis may be painful or painless swelling, often with stiffness in the morning, and is usually a symmetric polyarthritis affecting large and small joints. Tenosynovitis is often pres- ent, but joint erosions or other radiographic changes are rare. Renal disease in SLE is often asymptomatic, underscoring the need for careful monitoring of blood pressure and urinalyses; in adolescents, SLE can present with nephrotic syndrome and/or renal failure, with the predominant symptoms being edema, fatigue, changes in urine color, and nausea/vomiting. Because SLE symptoms and findings may develop seri- ally over several years and not all be present simultaneously, the diagnosis may require longitudinal follow-up. SLE is often characterized by periods of flare and disease quiescence but may follow a more smoldering disease course. The neuropsychiatric complications of SLE may occur with or without apparently active SLE, posing a particularly difficult diagnostic challenge in adolescents, who are already at high risk for mood disorders (Fig. 199.2). Long-term complications of SLE and its therapy, including accelerated atherosclerosis and osteoporosis, become clinically evident in early to middle adulthood. SLE is a disease that evolves over time in each affected individual, and new manifestations arise even many years after diagnosis.

DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of SLE requires a comprehensive clinical and laboratory assessment revealing characteristic multisystem disease and excluding other etiologies, including infection and malignancy. Classication criteria for SLE were developed to identify appropriate subjects for clinical trials but are often used as guideposts for SLE diagnosis.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Multiorgan disease is the hallmark of SLE, and given its wide array of potential clinical manifestations, SLE is in the differential diagnosis of many clinical scenarios, including unexplained fevers, joint pain or arthritis, rash, cytopenias, nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, pleural or pericardial effusions or other cardiopulmonary abnormalities, and new-onset psychosis or seizures. For patients ultimately diagnosed with pediatric SLE, the initial differential diagnosis often includes infections (sepsis, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, endocarditis), malignan- cies (leukemia and lymphoma), poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, other rheumatologic conditions (juvenile idiopathic arthritis, vasculi- tides), and drug-induced lupus (lable 199.4). Drug-induced lupus refers to the presence of SLE manifestations triggered by exposure to specific medications, including hydrala- zine, minocycline, many anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, antiar- rhythmic agents, and other drugs (Table 199.5). In individuals prone to SLE, these agents may act as a trigger for true SLE, but more commonly these agents provoke a reversible lupus-like syndrome. Unlike SLE, drug-induced lupus affects males and females equally. A genetic predisposition toward slow drug acetylation may increase the risk of drug-induced lupus. Circulating antihistone antibodies are often present in drug-induced SLE; these antibodies are only detected in up to 20% of individuals with SLE. Hepatitis, which is rare in SLE, is more common in drug-induced lupus. Individuals with drug-induced lupus are less likely to demonstrate antibodies to dsDNA, hypocomplementemia, and significant renal or neuro- logic disease. In contrast to SLE, manifestations of drug-induced Chapter 199 • Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 1495 Table 199.5 Medications Associated with Drug-Induced Lupus DEFINITE ASSOCIATION Minocycline, procainamide, hydralazine, isoniazid, penicillamine, diltiazem, interferon-a, methyldopa, chlorpromazine, etanercept, infliximao, adalimumab PROBABLE ASSOCIATION Phenytoin, ethosuximide, carbamazepine, sulfasalazine, amiodarone, quinidine, rifampin, nitrofurantoin, ß blockers, lithium, captopril, interferon-y, hydrochlorothiazide, glyburide, docetaxel, penicillin, tetracycline, statins, gold, valproate, griseofulvin, gemfibrozil, propylthiouracil Table 199.6 Autoantibodies Commonly Associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) ANTIBODY CLINICAL ASSOCIATION Anti-double-stranded DNA Correlates with disease activity, (anti-dsDNA) especially nephritis, in some with SLE Anti-Smith antibody Specific for the diagnosis of SLE anti-Sm) Anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody (anti-RNP) Anti-Ro antibody (anti-SSA) Anti-La antibody (anti-SSB) Increased risk for Raynaud phenomenon, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension Associated with sicca syndrome May suggest diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome Increased risk of neonatal lupus in offspring (congenital heart block) May be associated with cutaneous and pulmonary manifestations of SLE May be associated with isolated discoid lupus Increased risk for venous and arterial thrombotic events Antiphospholipid antibodies (including lupus anticoagulant and anti- cardiolipin or anti-beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies) Antihistone antibodies Present in a majority of patients with drug-induced lupus May be present in SLE lupus typically resolve after withdrawal of the offending medica- tion; however, complete recovery may take several months to years, requiring treatment, often with hydroxychloroquine, NSAIDs, and/ or corticosteroids. LABORATORY FINDINGS A positive ANA test is present in 95-99% of individuals with SLE. The ANA has poor specificity for SLE, as up to 20% of healthy indi- viduals also have a positive ANA test result, making the ANA a poor screen for SLE when used in isolation. After diagnosis, ANA titers are not reflective of disease activity; therefore repeat ANA testing in SLE patients is not helpful. Antibodies to ds DNA are specific for SLE, and in many individuals, anti-dsDNA levels correlate with disease activity, particularly in those with significant nephritis. Anti-Smith antibody, although found specifically in patients with SLE, does not correlate with disease activity. Serum levels of total hemolytic com- plement (CHso), C3, and C4 are typically decreased in active disease and often improve with treatment. Table 199.6 lists autoantibodies 

1496 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) found in SLE along with their clinical associations. Hypergamma- globulinemia is a common but nonspecific finding. Inflammatory markers, particularly the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are often elevated in active disease. C-reactive protein (CRP) correlates less well with disease activity; significantly elevated CRP values often reflect infection, whereas chronic mild elevation of CRP may indicate increased cardiovascular risk. Antiphospholipid antibodies, which increase clotting risk, can be found in up to 66% of children and adolescents with SLE. The primary antiphospholipid antibodies are lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies. When an arterial or venous clotting event occurs in the presence of an antiphospholipid antibody, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is diagnosed. Antiphospho- lipid antibody syndrome can occur in the context of SLE (secondary) or independent of SLE (primary) (see Chapter 528). Rarely, antiphos- pholipid antibodies can result in catastrophic antiphospholipid syn- drome, a condition in which clots affect three or more organs/tissues simultaneously; this condition has a very high mortality rate. TREATMENT Treatment of SLE is tailored to the individual and is based on specific disease manifestations and medication tolerability. For all patients, sunscreen and avoidance of prolonged direct sun exposure and other ultraviolet light may help control disease and should be reinforced at every visit with the patient. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended for all individuals with SLE when tolerated. In addition to treating mild SLE manifestations such as rash and mild arthritis, hydroxychloroquine prevents SLE flares, improves lipid profiles, and may have a beneficial impact on mortality and renal outcomes. Potential toxicities include retinal pigmentation that leads to vision impairment; therefore annual ophthalmology exams are recommended for patients taking hydroxychlo- roquine, including automated visual held testing and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Given that risk factors for ocular toxicity include duration of use and dose, hydroxychloroquine in SLE should not be prescribed at doses greater than 5 mg/kg to a maximum of 400 mg daily. Corticosteroids are a treatment mainstay for significant manifes- tations of SLE and work quickly to improve acute deterioration; side effects often limit patient adherence, especially in adolescence, and potential toxicities are worrisome. It is important to limit the dose and length of exposure to corticosteroids whenever possible. Potential consequences of corticosteroid therapy include growth disturbance, weight gain, striae, acne, hyperglycemia, hypertension, cataracts, avas- cular necrosis, and osteoporosis. The optimal dosing of corticosteroids in children and adolescents with SLE remains unknown; severe dis- ease is often treated with high doses of intravenous methylpredniso- lone (e.g., 30 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 1,000 mg for each of 3 days, sometimes followed by a period of weekly pulses) and/or high doses of oral prednisone (often starting at 1 mg/kg/day). As disease manifestations improve, corticosteroid dosages are gradually tapered over months. For most patients it is necessary to introduce a steroid- sparing immunosuppressive medication in order to limit cumulative steroid exposure. Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of pediatric SLE include methotrexate, leflunomide, azathioprine, myco- phenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and beli- mumab. Methotrexate, leflunomide, and azathioprine are often used to treat persistent moderate disease, including arthritis, significant cuta- neous or hematologic involvement, and pleural disease. Cyclophos- phamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine are appropriate for the treatment of lupus nephritis, whereas mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab are often used for the treatment of significant hematologic manifestations, including severe leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, or thrombocytopenia. Cyclophosphamide, usually administered intravenously, is reserved for the most severe, potentially life-threatening SLE manifestations, such as renal, neurologic, and cardiopulmonary disease. Although cyclophosphamide is highly effective in controlling disease, the poten- tial toxicities are significant, including cytopenias, infection, hemor- rhagic cystitis, premature gonadal failure, and increased risk of future malignancy. Attention to adequate hydration can attenuate the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis. Fortunately, young females are at much lower risk of gonadal failure than older women, and the use of gonadotropin- releasing hormone agonists, such as leuprolide acetate, may help pre- vent gonadal failure. The Childhood Arthritis Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) has developed a consensus treatment plan for induction therapy of newly diagnosed proliferative lupus nephritis (class III and IV) that is specific to the pSLE population; the treatment plan is considered necessary for class III and IV lupus nephritis but also appropriate for certain patients with other classes of lupus nephritis. The CARRA treatment plan advises 6 months of induction therapy with either cyclophosphamide (given per the National Institutes of Health [NIH] protocol as 500-1,000 mg/m' IV monthly) or myco- phenolate mofetil (dosed as 600 mg/m' bid up to 1,500 mg bid), used in combination with one of three standardized glucocorticoid regi- mens. For patients who fail to achieve a partial response in 6 months, it is appropriate to switch agents. For adult-weight adolescents, the cyclophosphamide dosing regimen used in the Euro-Lupus Nephritis Trial can be considered in lieu of the previous 6-month therapy in an effort to reduce toxicity from cyclophosphamide exposure. Per this protocol, a fixed dose of 500 mg is given every 2 weeks for 3 months; in adults, this regimen is althought to reduce adverse effects while maintaining comparable efficacy for lupus nephritis, though this reg- imen has not been studied specifically in pediatric lupus. It should be noted that oral medication adherence is very poor in pSLE, and this must be taken into consideration when weighing the benefits of an IV infusion versus a twice daily oral medication such as mycophenolate mofetil. After the 6-month induction therapy, maintenance therapy for lupus nephritis consists of quarterly IV cyclophosphamide (dosed 500-1,000 mg/m' once every 3 months), mycophenolate, or azathio- prine, with mycophenolate generally being the preferred agent. Main- tenance therapy is typically continued for a minimum of 30 months after the completion of induction therapy, but in many circumstances, it is continued longer. Calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus are often adjunct therapy in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis. Voclosporin, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for adults with lupus nephri- tis, awaits pediatric study. Clinical trial data on the use of rituximab in SLE with treatment-resistant glomerulonephritis has been largely disappointing, but post hoc analysis from the LUNAR study suggests there may be benefit for subpopulations of SLE patients. The FDA has approved the use of belimumab, a monoclonal antibody against BLyS/ BAFE, for the treatment of lupus in adults and children; when added to standard SLE therapy, belimumab improves markers of disease activity in renal and nonrenal lupus. Belimumab has been shown to improve renal outcomes in adults, and while it is not used as monotherapy to treat lupus nephritis, it can be used in addition to standard therapy to help achieve renal remission without substantial increase in risk of infectious complications. Anifrolumab (a monoclonal antibody to the interferon-a receptor), achieved 2021 FDA approval for treatment of adult nonrenal SLE, and studies in lupus nephritis and pediatric lupus are forthcoming. Several novel therapies are in the pipeline for the treatment of SLE and lupus nephritis, including Janus kinase inhibitors. Given the lifelong nature of SLE, optimal care of children and adoles- cents with this disease also involves preventive practices. Owing to the enhanced risk of atherosclerosis in SLE, attention to cholesterol levels, smoking status, body mass index, blood pressure, and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors is warranted. Even though the Atheroscle- rosis Prevention in Pediatric Lupus Erythematosus (APPLE) study failed to support placing all children with SLE on a statin, post hoc analyses suggest that statins can be considered for primary prevention of atherosclerotic disease in certain clinical circumstances, particularly pubertal patients with an elevated CRP.

Textbook of Pediatric Rheumatology, 6th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders; 2011. SLE patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (antiphos- pholipid antibodies and a history of arterial or venous clot or preg- nancy morbidity) are treated with long-term anticoagulation to prevent thrombotic events; for SLE patients who are antiphospholipid antibody positive without a history of clots, many pediatric rheumatologists pre- scribe aspirin 81 mg daily. For all SLE patients, adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is nec- essary to prevent future osteoporosis, particularly as vitamin D levels are lower in pSLE patients compared with age-matched healthy controls. It is worth noting recent studies suggest a link between hypovitaminosis D and SLE susceptibility and also offer an emerging role for vitamin D in immunomodulation. Infections, particularly pneumococcal disease, commonly com- plicate SLE, so routine immunization is recommended, including the annual influenza vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and vaccination against human papilloma virus (HPV). In addition, pSLE patients age 6 or older should receive a dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after completing all recommended pneumococcal vac- cine series with PCV13 or PCV15. Many of the immunosuppressant medications used in SLE contraindicate administration of live vac- cines. Prompt attention to febrile episodes should include an evalu- ation for serious infections. Because pSLE patients are at high risk for developing anxiety and depression, screening for depression is important. Peer support and cognitive-behavioral therapy interven- tions reduce pain and enhance resilience in pSLE. Pregnancy can worsen SLE, and obstetric complications are com- mon. In addition, many medications used to treat SLE are terato- genic. As a consequence, it is important to counsel adolescent girls about these risks and facilitate access to appropriate contraceptive options. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended throughout preg- nancy for all SLE patients, whereas other medications may need to be adjusted. COMPLICATIONS Within the first several years of diagnosis, the most common causes of death in individuals with SLE include infection and complications of glomerulonephritis and neuropsychiatric disease (Table 199.7). Over the long term, the most common causes of mortality are atherosclerosis and malignancy. The increased risk of premature atherosclerosis in SLE is not explained by traditional risk factors and is partly a result of the chronic immune dysregula- tion and inflammation associated with SLE. Increased malignancy rates may be caused by immune dysregulation and exposure to Chapter 199 • Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 1497 Table 199.8 A Summary of Signs and Symptoms Indicative of Lupus Emergencies SIGNS/SYMPTOMS Fever DIFFERENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS Evaluate for infection Consider disease flare Consider macrophage activation syndrome Thrombosis/hemoptysis May be arterial or venous Evaluate for antiphospholipid syndrome Chest pain Pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary infarction/embolus Dyspnea Pneumonitis, alveolar hemorrhage, pleural effusions, congestive heart failure Headache Vascular headaches, meningitis, thrombus, cerebrovascular accident, hypertensive crisis Altered mental status Cerebritis, hypertensive crisis, macro- phage activation syndrome, stroke, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome Rash Vasculitis lesions, palpable purpura, infarction Icterus Autoimmune hemolysis Autoimmune hepatitis Petechiae Seizure Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura Cerebritis, infection, metabolic causes, hypertensive crisis From Harry O, Yasin S, Brunner H.

Potential lupus emergen- cies are noted in Table 199.8. PROGNOSIS SLE disease severity is higher in childhood-onset SLE compared with adult-onset SLE. Fortunately, advances in the diagnosis and treat- ment of SLE have led to dramatically improved survival over the past 50 years. The 5-year and 10-year survival rates for pSLE are 99% and 97%, respectively, in high-income countries, although these survival rates are 85% and 79%, respectively, in low- and middle-income coun- tries. Infection contributes significantly to mortality in pediatric lupus. In addition, early in the disease course, lupus nephritis, lupus cereb- ritis, and complications such as macrophage activation syndrome are primary causes of mortality, whereas later in the disease course, ath- erosclerosis and malignancy become larger contributors to mortality. Given their long burden of disease, children and adolescents with SLE face high risks of future morbidity and mortality from the disease and its complications, as well as medication side effects. Because pSLE is a complex, chronic disease with a high risk for morbidity and mortality, optimal care for children and adolescents with SLE includes treatment by pediatric rheumatologists in a multidisciplinary clinic with access to a full complement of pediatric subspecialists. Furthermore, because SLE is a lifelong disease, it is critically important to ensure an appropri- ate transition to an adult model of care, which helps avoid interrup- tions in rheumatology care.

1498 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) 199.1 Neonatal Lupus Deborah M. Friedman, Jill P. Buyon, Rebecca E. Sadun, and Stacy P. Ardoin Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE), an entity distinct from SLE, is one of the few rheumatic disorders manifesting in the neonate. NLE is not an autoimmune disease of the fetus, but instead results from passively acquired autoimmunity, when maternal immunoglobulin G autoanti- bodies cross the placenta and enter the fetal circulation. In contrast to SLE, neonatal lupus is not characterized by ongoing immune dysregula- tion, although infants with neonatal lupus may be at some increased risk for development of future autoimmune disease. The vast majority of NLE cases are associated with maternal anti-Ro (also known as SSA), anti-La antibodies (also known as SSB), or anti-RNP autoantibodies. Despite the clear association with maternal autoantibodies, their presence alone is not sufficient to cause disease, as only ~2% of offspring born to mothers with anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies develop neona- tal lupus. Increasing evidence supports the observation that generally high maternal anti-Ro titers are necessary for fetal clinical disease. In the prospective evaluation of fetuses with autoimmune-associated congenital heart block followed in the PR Interval and Dexamethasone Evaluation (PRIDE) study, the median anti-Ro titer for pregnancies resulting in heart block was 5 times as high as the median anti-Ro titer in unaffected pregnancies. Another group identified heart block in 8% of cases with very high anti-Ro antibody titers, with no cases among women with low or moderate titers. Siblings of infants with NLE have a 15-20% chance of develop- ing NLE. Neonatal lupus seems to be independent of the maternal health because many mothers are asymptomatic and only identified to have anti-Ro/anti-La antibodies subsequent to the diagnosis of NLE. Roughly half of the infants with NLE are born to the mothers with a defined rheumatic disease such as Sjogren syndrome or SLE. Clinical manifestations of neonatal lupus include a characteristic annular or macular rash typically affecting the face (especially the periorbital area), trunk, and scalp (Fig. 199.4). The rash can be pres- ent at birth but more often appears within the first 6-8 weeks of life, after exposure to ultraviolet light, and typically lasts 3-4 months. Infants may also have cytopenias and hepatitis, each occurring in ~25% of cases, but the most concerning complication is congenital heart block. Conduction system abnormalities range from prolongation of the PR interval to complete heart block, with development of progressive cardiomyopathy in the most severe cases. The noncardiac manifesta- tions of neonatal lupus are usually reversible, whereas third-degree congenital heart block is permanent. Conduction system abnormalities can be detected in utero by fetal echocardiogram beginning at 16 weeks of gestational age. Neonatal lupus cardiac disease has a mortality rate of ~20%. Cardiac NLE can manifest as heart block, cardiomyopathy, valvular dysfunction, and endocardial fibroelastosis. Fetal bradycardia from heart block can lead to hydrops fetalis. In vitro studies suggest that during cardiac development via apop- tosis, Ro and La antigens may be exposed on the surface of cardiac cells in the proximity of the atrioventricular node, making the antigens accessible to maternal autoantibodies. Binding incites a local immune response, resulting in fibrosis within the conduction system and more extensive disease in fatal cases. In the skin, exposure to ultraviolet light results in cell damage and the subsequent exposure of Ro and La anti- gens, inducing a similar local inflammatory response that produces the characteristic rash. Although the scant clinical trial data have been mixed, fluori- nated corticosteroids (dexamethasone or betamethasone), intra- venous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 1-2 g/kg maternal weight, plasmapheresis, hydroxychloroquine, and terbutaline (combined with steroids) have been used in pregnant women with anti-Ro or anti-La antibodies to prevent occurrence or progression of fetal car- Fig. 199.4 Neonatal lupus syndrome. Typical rash, often photosensi- tive with a malar distribution, appearing as annular plaques with ery- thema and scaling. (From Pain C, Beresford MW. Neonatal lupus syn- drome. Paediatr Child Health. 2007;17:223-227.) Most encouraging are retrospective cohort studies suggesting mater- nal treatment with hydroxychloroquine may reduce the frequency and recurrence of congenital heart block. In a multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trial assessing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to prevent recurrent autoantibody-associated congenital heart block, hydroxychloroquine treatment reduced the risk of recurrent heart block compared to historical controls by over 50%, from 17.5% to less than 8% of pregnancies. Significant conduction system abnormalities after birth are treated with cardiac pacing and occasionally IVIG and steroids, whereas severe cardiomyopathy may require cardiac transplantation. If the conduction defect is not addressed, affected children are at risk for exercise intoler- ance, arrhythmias, and death. With cardiac pacing, however, children with conduction system disease in the absence of cardiomyopathy have an excellent prognosis. In a long-term follow-up study of 239 subjects enrolled in the Research Registry for Neonatal Lupus, 22% of subjects had cardiac dysfunction in the first year of life. Cardiac dysfunction often regressed; nevertheless, some dysfunction did appear later in childhood. Risk factors for cardiac dysfunction were being male or of low socioeconomic status and having low fetal heart rates, a longer period of pacing, or extranodal cardiac disease. In a Swedish cohort of 119 children with congenital heart block, 16.8% developed cardiomy- opathy ‡ congestive heart failure. Congenital heart block increased the risk of cerebral infarctions and infections. Pacemaker treatment was associated with decreased risk of developing cerebral infarction but increased risk of infection and cardiomyopathy. Noncardiac manifestations are typically transient and are con- servatively managed, often with supportive care alone. Topical ste- roids can be used to treat moderate to severe NLE rash. Cytopenias may improve over time but severe cases occasionally require IVIG. Supportive care is usually appropriate for hepatic and neurologic manifestation. When the neonate clears maternal autoantibodies over the first 6 months of life, these inflammatory manifestations gradually resolve.

All such preg- nancies should include counseling and serial fetal echocardiograms. Because maternal autoantibodies begin to gain access to the fetus through the placenta via FcRn at about 12 weeks gestation, all preg- nant women with circulating anti-Ro and/or anti-La antibodies, or those with a history of offspring with neonatal lupus or congenital heart block, are generally advised to be monitored by a pediatric car- diologist, with screening fetal echocardiography performed weekly or biweekly from 17-26 weeks of gestation. The period of greatest vulnerability is usually 18-24 weeks. If fetal bradycardia is found dur- ing routine in utero monitoring in a mother never evaluated for the putative antibodies and if fetal echocardiography confirms a conduc- tion defect, screening for maternal anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies is warranted. In pregnancies at risk for congenital heart block, maternal home monitoring of fetal heart rate using a handheld fetal heart rate monitor 2-3 times daily allows for accurate and early detection of heart rate abnormalities. A proposed management algorithm is presented in Figure 199.5. A multicenter retrospective study concluded that maternal treat- ment with dexamethasone and/or intravenous gamma globulin should be initiated in all cases of anti-SSA/Ro antibody cardiac manifestations, including signiticant hrst-degree or any higher atrioventricular block, isolated endocardial fibroelastosis, or sinus bradycardia. However, other studies suggest that treatment should be individualized to fetuses at high risk and not universally instituted for isolated complete third- degree block, which is generally considered immutable. The negative predictive value of antibody titers to identify pregnan- cies at low risk of fetal atrioventricular block has also been studied. Excluding women with previously aftected children, leveraging sam- ples obtained from anti-SSA/Ro exposed pregnancies with and without fetal atrioventricular block, no case of heart block developed among subjects with anti-Ro52 and anti-Ro60 titers of <110 arbitrary units per milliliter using the multiplex bead assay of the Associated Regional and University Pathologists Laboratories (n=141). Applying these 100% negative predictive value thresholds, approximately 50% of the anti-Ro/SSA antibody pregnancies that ultimately had no fetal atrio- ventricular block could be excluded from surveillance. Emerging data suggest that not all mothers with anti-SSA/Ro anti- bodies require surveillance. Based on review of the literature, the Society ded Maternal Feal Melicardiblished guiseline hao ec PR interval not be routinely performed in patients with anti-SSA/SSB antibodies outside of a clinical trial setting" but rather that, "Doppler assessment of fetal heart rate during routine prenatal visits can be used to screen for fetal complete heart block.

1500 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) Chapter 200 Juvenile Dermatomyositis Jeffrey A. Dvergsten and Ann M. Reed Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is the most common of the juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIMs), representing up to 85% of all patients with these rare vasculopathic diseases. It is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and distinctive rashes of the face and extensor joint surfaces. EPIDEMIOLOGY The incidence of JDM is approximately 3 cases/1 million children/yr, with an incidence similar in White and Black non-Hispanics and an apparent lower incidence in Hispanics. The peak age of onset is 7 years with a second peak of onset in late adulthood (45-64 years); however, adult-onset dermatomyositis appears to be a distinctly separate entity, both in prognosis and etiology. In the United States the ratio of females to males with JDM is 2:1. Multiple cases of myositis in a single family are rare, but familial autoimmune disease may be increased in families with children who have JDM when compared to families of children without autoimmune disease. Reports of seasonal association have not been confirmed, although clusters of cases may occur. ETIOLOGY A precise understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of JDM remains elusive; many factors that affect elements of innate and adap- tive immunity have been identified as contributing to onset and per- petuation of disease. Evidence suggests that the etiology of JDM is multifaceted, with a genetic predisposition influenced by an environ- mental factor triggering events leading to disease pathogenesis. Genetic factors that are associated with increased susceptibility to JDM include human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles DRB1*0301, DQA1*0501, and DQA1*0301. Additionally, HLA-DQA1*0501 is found on maternal cells present in blood and tissue samples of chil- dren with JDM, an example of maternal microchimerism, which has been proposed to play an etiologic role in JDM by creating an immune response comparable to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Other polymorphisms implicated in JDM include those affecting cytokine genes such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a promoter and the variable-number tandem repeats of the interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist Al gene. An increase in TNF-a may be associated with persistent immune activation leading to a longer disease course. The IL-1 receptor antagonist Al allele is associated with the development of JIIM in White but not in Black persons, in whom the A3 allele, instead, is a possible risk factor. Environmental factors may also play a contributing role, with geographic and seasonal clustering reported Short-term increases in ultraviolet (UV) index before the onset of disease have been reported; however, no clear theory of etiology has emerged. A history of infection in the 3 months before disease onset is usually reported; multiple studies have failed to produce a causative organism. Constitutional signs and upper respiratory symptoms pre- dominate, but one third of patients report preceding gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Group A streptococcus, upper respiratory infections, GI infections, coxsackievirus B, toxoplasma, enteroviruses, parvovirus B19, and multiple other organisms have been postulated as possible pathogens in the etiology of JDM. Despite these concerns, results of serum antibody testing and polymerase chain reaction amplification of the blood and muscle tissue for multiple infectious diseases have not been revealing. PATHOGENESIS JDM and related immune myositis syndromes are believed to be an autoimmune vasculopathic inflammatory disease affecting capillaries of multiple organs, but most notably, the skin, muscles, and GI tract (Table 200.1). Pathogenic mechanisms are both immune and nonim- mune with cellular and soluble constituents of the innate and adap- tive immune systems and pathways of cellular injury involved. Type I interferons (IFNs), principally a and ß, are cytokines of the innate immune system that play a significant role in the pathogenesis of JDM by modulating several immune mechanisms, including upregu- lation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on muscle cells; induction of proinflammatory cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule production; and supporting cytotoxic effects of innate and adaptive immune cells. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play an important role in JDM and are principal producers of type I IFN upon activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 on their surface by viruses. Cells involved in the inflammatory cascade include mono- cytes/macrophages (CD14), T-cell subsets (CD4, CD8, Th17), natural killer (NK) cells (CD56), and dendritic cells (DCs). MHC class I upreg- ulation induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which results in the degradation of contractile proteins; additional downstream effects of type I IFN include autoantibody production and B-cell proliferation. Galectin-9 and CXCL10 (IP-10) are two IFN-related proteins that have been validated as sensitive and specific peripheral biomarkers of dis- ease activity in JDM. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Children with JDM present with either rash, insidious onset of weak- ness, or both. Fevers, dysphagia or dysphonia, arthritis, muscle ten- derness, and fatigue are also commonly reported at diagnosis (Tables 200.2 and 200.3). Certain myositis-specific antibodies are associated with different phenotypic patterns of disease (Fig. 200.1). Rash develops as the first symptom in 50% of patients and appears concomitant with weakness only 25% of the time. Children often exhibit extreme photosensitivity to UV light exposure with general- ized erythema in sun-exposed areas. If seen over the chest and neck, this erythema is known as the shawl sign. Erythema is also commonly seen over the knees and elbows. The characteristic heliotrope rash is a blue-violet discoloration of the eyelids that may be associated with periorbital edema (Fig. 200.2). Facial erythema crossing the nasolabial folds is also common, in contrast to the malar rash without nasolabial involvement typical of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Classic Gottron papules are bright-pink or pale, shiny, thickened, or atrophic plaques over the metacarpal phalangeal joints, proximal interphalan- geal joints, and distal interphalangeal joints and occasionally on the knees, elbows, small joints of the toes, and ankle malleoli (Fig. 200.3). The rash of JDM is sometimes mistaken for eczema or psoriasis. Rarely, a thickened erythematous and scaly rash develops in children over the palms (known as mechanic's hands) and soles along the flexor ten- dons, which is associated with anti-Jo-1 antibodies. Evidence of small vessel inflammation is often visible in the nail folds and gums as individual capillaries display changes including loops, thickening, tortuosity, or loss (Fig. 200.4C). Telangiectasias may be visible to the naked eye but are more easily visualized under cap- illaroscopy or with another magnifier (e.g., ophthalmoscope). Severe vascular inflammation causes cutaneous ulcers on toes, fingers, axillae, Early in disease, weakness associated with JDM is often insidious and difficult to differentiate from fatigue. It is typically symmetric, affecting proximal muscles such as the neck flexors, shoulder girdle, and hip flexors. Parents may report difficulty climbing stairs, combing hair, and getting out of bed. Examination reveals inability to perform a sit-up, head lag in a child after infancy, and Gower sign (use of hands climbing on thighs to help stand from a sitting position). Patients with JDM may roll to the side rather than sit straight up from lying to com- pensate for truncal weakness. Approximately half of children exhibit muscle tenderness because of muscle inflammation. Esophageal and respiratory muscles are also affected, resulting in aspiration or respiratory failure. It is essential to assess for dysphonia or nasal speech, palatal elevation with gag, dysphagia, and gastroesopha- geal reflux by means of history and physical examination. If any of these are abnormal, a swallow study should be pursued. Respiratory muscle weakness can be a medical emergency and lead to respiratory failure.

Juvenile dermatomyositis. In: Cassidy JT, Petty RE, Laxer RM, etal., eds. Textbook of Pediatric Rheumatology, 6th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders; 2011: Table 24.20, p. 410. Children with respiratory muscle weakness do not manifest typical symptoms of impending respiratory failure with increased work of breathing, instead demonstrating hypercarbia rather than hypoxemia. Evaluation of respiratory muscle function by negative inspiratory force (NIF) measurement can be performed in the clinic or at the bedside. DIAGNOSIS Diagnosis of dermatomyositis requires the presence of a characteris- tic rash and at least three signs of muscle inflammation and weakness (see Table 200.2). Diagnostic criteria developed in 1975 predate the use of MRI and have not been validated in children. Diagnosis is often delayed because of the insidious nature of disease onset. Electromyography (EMG) shows signs of myopathy (increased insertional activity, hbrillations, sharp waves) and muscle hber necro- sis (decreased action potential amplitude and duration). Nerve con- duction studies are typically normal unless severe muscle necrosis and atrophy are present. It is important that EMG be performed in a cen- ter with experience in pediatric EMG and its interpretation. Muscle biopsy is typically indicated when the diagnosis is in doubt or for grad- ing disease severity (see Fig. 200.4A). Biopsy of involved muscle reveals focal necrosis and phagocytosis of muscle fibers, fiber regeneration, endomysial proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltrates and vasculitis, and tubuloreticular inclusion bodies within endothelial cells. Findings of lymphoid structures and vasculopathy may portend more severe Some children present with classic rash but no apparent muscle weakness or inflammation; this variation is called amyopathic JDM or dermatomyositis sine myositis. It is unclear whether these children have isolated skin disease or mild undetected muscle inflammation, risking progression to more severe muscle involvement with long-term sequelae such as calcinosis and lipodystrophy if untreated. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The differential diagnosis depends on the presenting symptoms. If the presenting complaint is solely weakness without rash or atypi- cal disease, other causes of myositis or myopathy should be consid- ered, including polymyositis, infection-related myositis (influenza A and B, coxsackievirus B, and other viral illnesses), muscular dys- trophies (e.g., Duchenne, Becker), myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, endocrinopathies (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Cushing syndrome, Addison disease, parathyroid disorders), mito- chondrial myopathies, TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), and metabolic disorders (glycogen and lipid storage dis- eases). Infections associated with prominent muscular symptoms include trichinosis, Bartonella infection, toxoplasmosis, staphylococ- cal pyomyositis, and SARS-CoV-2. Blunt trauma and crush injuries may lead to transient rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria. Myositis in children may also be associated with vaccinations, drugs, growth hormone, and GVHD. The rash of JDM may be confused with dys- hidrotic eczema, psoriasis, erythema nodosa, malar rash from SLE, capillary telangiectasias from Raynaud phenomenon, and other rheu- matic diseases. Muscle inflammation is also seen in children with SLE, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, mixed connective tissue disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic anti- body-positive vasculitides. Necrotizing immune-mediated myopa- thies are characterized by muscle necrosis without lymphocytic infiltration. Antibodies to signal recognition particle (SRP) or 3-hydr oxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) distinguish the two types from each other and from JDM. Table 200.4 compares other juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myositis disorders: JDM, juvenile polymyositis, and juvenile connective tissue myositis. LABORATORY FINDINGS Elevated serum levels of muscle-derived enzymes (creatine kinase [CK], aldolase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase [ALT], lactate dehydrogenase) reflect muscle inflammation. Not all enzyme levels rise with inflammation in a specific individual; ALT is usually elevated on initial presentation, whereas CK level may be normal.

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is often normal, and the rheumatoid factor (RF) test result is typically negative. There may be anemia consistent with chronic disease. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) is present in >80% of children with JDM. Serologic testing results are divided into two groups: myositis-associated antibodies Fig. 200.3 The rash of juvenile dermatomyositis. The skin over the metacarpal and proximal interphalangeal joints may be hypertrophic and pale red (Gottron papules). (MAAs) and myositis-specific antibodies (MSAs) (see Table 200.1). MAAs are associated with JDM but are not specific and can be seen in both overlap conditions and other rheumatic diseases. The pres- ence of MAAs such as SSA, SSB, Sm, ribonucleoprotein (RNP), and double-stranded (ds) DNA may increase the likelihood of overlap disease or connective tissue myositis. Antibodies to Pm/Scl identify a small, distinct subgroup of myopathies with a protracted disease course, often complicated by pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and car- diac involvement. MSAs are specific for myositis and are identified in

Lancet. 2008;371:2201-2212, Fig. 3, p. 2205.) approximately 40-60% of children with JIM. These antibodies sug- gest a diagnosis of myositis, and their presence may define distinct clinical subsets and may predict prognosis. Anti-TIF-1-y antibod- ies are reported in 23-30% of children with JDM and are associated with photosensitive rashes, ulceration, and lipodystrophy. Unlike in adults, this antibody is not associated with malignancy in children with JDM. Anti-NXP2 antibodies are reported in 12-23% of children with JDM and are associated with cramps, muscle atrophy, contrac- tures, and dysphonia. Anti-MDA5 antibodies are found in approxi- mately 7% of children with JDM and may predict the development of interstitial lung disease (ILD). Because certain MSAs have defined clinical phenotypes in JDM and IFN-related biomarkers that may correlate with disease activity, there is interest in assessing IN sig- nature by MSA type. Radiographic studies aid both diagnosis and medical management. MRI using T2-weighted images and fat suppression (see Fig. 200.4B) identifies active sites of disease, reducing sampling error and increas- ing the sensitivity of muscle biopsy and EMG, results of which are nondiagnostic in 20% of cases if the procedures are not directed by MRI. Extensive rash and abnormal MRI findings may be found despite normal serum levels of muscle-derived enzymes. Muscle biopsy often demonstrates evidence of disease activity and chronicity that is not sus- pected from the levels of the serum enzymes alone. A contrast swallow study may document palatal dysfunction and risk of aspiration. Pulmonary function testing detects a restrictive defect consistent with respiratory weakness and reduced diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide from alveolar fibrosis associated with other con- nective tissue diseases. Serial measurement of vital capacity or negative inspiratory force can document changes in respiratory weakness, espe- cially in an inpatient setting. Calcinosis is seen easily on radiographs, along the fascial planes, and within muscles (see Figs. 200.4D and E and Fig. 200.5). TREATMENT The aid of an experienced pediatric rheumatologist is invaluable in outlining an appropriate course of treatment for a child with JDM. Before the advent of corticosteroids, one third of patients spontane- ously improved; a third had a chronic, lingering course; and a third died from the disease. Corticosteroids have altered the course of the disease, lowering morbidity and mortality. Methotrexate decreases the length of treatment with corticosteroids, thereby reducing morbidity from steroid toxicity. Intravenous (IV) gamma globulin is frequently used as an adjunct for the treatment of severe disease and can be given at 2 g/kg (maximum 70 g) every 2 weeks for three doses, then every 4 weeks as needed. The efficacy and safety have been reported in open- label studies. In the 2010 Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) treatment utilization report, IVIG was used most frequently for initial treatment of severe disease and treat- ment of refractory disease. It is also a steroid-sparing agent. Consensus treatment plans for guiding treatment of children with JDM are avail- able from CARRA online through PubMed and Figure 200.6. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment. In a clinically stable child without debilitating weakness, oral prednisone at 2 mg/ kg/day (maximum 60 mg daily) is recommended. Children with GI involvement may have decreased absorption of oral corticosteroids and require IV administration. In more severe cases with respiratory or oropharyngeal weakness, high-dose pulse methylprednisolone is used (30 mg/kg/day for 3 days, maximum dose 1 g/day) with ongoing weekly or monthly IV dosing along with daily oral corticosteroids as needed. Corticosteroid dosage is slowly tapered over 12 months, after indicators of inflammation (muscle enzymes) normalize and strength improves. Weekly oral, IV, or subcutaneous methotrexate (the lesser of 1 mg/kg or 15 mg/m*) is often used as a steroid-sparing agent in JDM. The con- comitant use of methotrexate halves the cumulative dosage of steroids needed for disease control. Risks of methotrexate include immunosup- pression, blood count dyscrasias, chemical hepatitis, pulmonary tox- icity, nausea/vomiting, and teratogenicity. Folic acid is typically given with methotrexate starting at a dose of 1 mg daily to reduce toxicity and side effects of folate inhibition (oral ulcers, nausea, anemia). Children who are taking immunosuppressive medications such as methotrex- ate should avoid live-virus vaccination, although inactivated influenza vaccination is recommended yearly. An international trial found the combination of methotrexate plus corticosteroids to perform better than corticosteroids alone and with fewer side effects than corticoste- roids plus cyclosporine A Hydroxychloroquine has little toxicity risk and is used as a second- ary disease-modifying agent to reduce rash and maintain remission.

Typically, it is administered at doses of 4-6 mg/kg/day orally in either tablet or liquid form. Ophthalmologic follow-up one time per year to monitor for rare retinal toxicity is recommended. Other side effects include hemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate deficiency, GI intolerance, and skin/hair discoloration. The use of rituximab in a trial of steroid-dependent patients with resistant inflammatory myopathies, including JDM, did not meet the primary study end-point showing a difference in time to improvement between individuals given rituximab at baseline or at 8 weeks, but over- all, 83% of all patients met the definition of improvement in the trial. Additionally, rituximab was noted to have a significant steroid-sparing Other medications used to treat severe refractory disease include mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide. Given the strong type I IFN signal in JDM and that these cytokines activate intracellular signaling through the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transduc- ers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway, consideration of JAK inhibitors, including tofacitinib, baricitinib, and ruxolitinib, as potential therapeutic candidates has been bolstered by case reports and case series that report generally promising results with these drugs in Children with pharyngeal weakness may need nasogastric or gas- trostomy feedings to avoid aspiration, whereas those with GI vasculitis require full bowel rest. Rarely, children with severe respiratory weak- ness require ventilator therapy and even tracheostomy until the respi- ratory weakness improves. Physical therapy and occupational therapy are integral parts of the treatment program, initially for passive stretching early in the disease course and then for direct reconditioning of muscles to regain strength and range of motion. Therapy may improve muscle strength measures and cardiovascular fitness. Bed rest is not indicated, because weight bearing improves bone density and prevents contractures. Social work and psychology services may facilitate adjustment to the frustration of physical impairment in a previously active child and aid with sleep disturbances associated with rheumatic disease. All children with JDM should avoid sun exposure and apply high- sun protection factor (SPF) sunscreen daily, even in winter and on cloudy days.

Rheum Dis Clin N Am. 2021;47:669-690, Fig. 1, p. 679.) children undergoing long-term corticosteroid therapy to reduce drug- induced osteopenia and osteoporosis. COMPLICATIONS Most complications from JDM are related to prolonged and severe weakness from muscle atrophy to cutaneous calcifications and scarring or atrophy to lipodystrophy. Secondary complications from medical treatments are also common. Children with acute and severe weak- ness are at risk for aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure and occasionally require nasogastric feeding and mechanical ventilation until weakness improves. Rarely, vasculitis of the GI tract develops in children with severe JDM. Crampy abdominal pain and occult GI bleeding may indicate bowel wall vasculitis and lead to ischemia, GI bleeding, and perforation if not treated with complete bowel rest and aggressive treatment for the underlying inflammation. Surgery should be avoided, if possible, because the GI vasculitis is diffuse and not easily amenable to surgical intervention. Contrast-enhanced CT may show dilation or thickening of the bowel wall, intraluminal air, or evidence of bowel necrosis. Involvement of the cardiac muscle with pericarditis, myocarditis, and conduction defects with arrhythmias has been reported, as has reduced diastolic and systolic function related to ongoing disease activity. Lipodystrophy and calcinosis are thought to be associated with long-standing or undertreated disease (see Fig. 200.4D-F). Dystrophic deposition of calcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite, or fluoroapatite crys- tals occurs in subcutaneous plaques or nodules, resulting in painful ulceration of the skin with extrusion of crystals or calcific liquid. Cal- cification is found in up to 40% of large cohorts of children with JDM. Pathologic calcifications may be related to severity of disease and pro- longed delay to treatment and potentially to genetic polymorphisms of TNF-a-308. Calcium deposits tend to form in subcutaneous tissue and along muscle. Some ulcerate through the skin and drain a soft calcific liquid, and others manifest as hard nodules along extensor surfaces or embedded along muscle. Draining lesions serve as a nidus for celluli- tis or osteomyelitis. Nodules cause skin inflammation that may mimic cellulitis. Spontaneous regression of calcium deposits may occur, but there is no evidence-based recommendation for treatment of calcino- sis. Some experts recommend aggressive treatment of underlying myo- sitis. Others have recommended bisphosphonates, TNF inhibitors, and sodium thiosulfate, but no evidence-based trials have been conducted for this condition. Lipodystrophy manifests in 10-40% of patients with JDM and can be difficult to recognize. Lipodystrophy results in progressive loss of subcutaneous and visceral fat, typically over the face and upper body, and may be associated with a metabolic syndrome similar to polycys- tic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance, hirsutism, acanthosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and abnormal glucose tolerance. Lipodystrophy may be generalized or localized. Children receiving prolonged corticosteroid therapy are prone to complications such as cessation of linear growth, weight gain, hirsut- ism, adrenal suppression, immunosuppression, striae, cushingoid fat deposition, mood changes, osteoporosis, cataracts, avascular necrosis, and steroid myopathy. Families should be counseled on the effects of corticosteroids and advised to use medical alert identification and to consult a nutritionist regarding a low-salt, low-fat diet with adequate vitamin D and calcium supplementation. An association with malignancy at disease onset is observed in adults with dermatomyositis but very rarely in children. PROGNOSIS The mortality rate in JDM has decreased since the advent of corti- costeroids, from 33% to currently approximately 1%; little is known about the long-term consequences of persistent vascular inflamma- tion. The period of active symptoms has decreased from about 3.5 years to <1.5 years with more aggressive immunosuppressive ther- apy; the vascular, skin, and muscle symptoms of children with JDM generally respond well to therapy. At 7 years of follow-up, 75% of patients have little to no residual disability, but 25% continue to have chronic weakness and 40% have chronic rash. Up to one-third may need long-term medications to control their disease. Children with JDM appear able to repair inflammatory damage to vasculature and muscle, but there is some emerging concern about long-term effects on cardiovascular risk.

Chapter 201 • Scleroderma and Raynaud Phenomenon 1507 Chapter 201 Scleroderma and Raynaud Phenomenon Heather A. Van Mater and C. Egla Rabinovich synthesize excessive amounts of collagen, resulting in fibrosis and subsequent lipoatrophy and dermal fibrosis, with loss of sweat glands and hair follicles. In late stages the entire dermis may be replaced by compact collagen fibers. Autoimmunity is believed to be a key process in the pathogenesis of both localized and systemic scleroderma, given the high percentage of affected children with autoantibodies (Table 201.1). Children with local- ized disease often have a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test result (42%), and 47% of this subgroup have antihistone antibodies. Children with JSSc have higher rates of ANA positivity (80.7%) and may have anti- Scl-70 antibody (34%, antitopoisomerase I). The relationship between specific autoantibodies and the various forms of scleroderma is not well understood, and all antibody test results may be negative, especially in JLS. Juvenile scleroderma encompasses a range of conditions unified by the presence of fibrosis of the skin. Juvenile scleroderma is divided into two major categories, juvenile localized scleroderma (JLS, also known as morphea), which is largely limited to the skin, and juvenile systemic sclerosis (JSSc), with multisystem organ involve- ment. Localized disease is the predominant type seen in pediatric populations (>95%), but systemic sclerosis is associated with mor- tality and severe multiorgan morbidity. ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS The etiology of scleroderma is unknown, but the mechanism of dis- ease appears to be a combination of a vasculopathy, autoimmunity, immune activation, and fibrosis. Triggers, including trauma, infec- tion, and, possibly, subclinical graft versus host reaction from per- sistent maternal cells (microchimerism), injure vascular endothelial cells, resulting in increased expression of adhesion molecules. These molecules entrap platelets and inflammatory cells, resulting in vascu- lar changes with manifestations such as Raynaud phenomenon and pulmonary hypertension. Inflammatory cells infiltrate the area of ini- tial vascular damage, causing further vascular damage and resulting in thickened artery walls and reduction in capillary numbers. Mac- rophages and other inflammatory cells then migrate into affected tis- sues and secrete cytokines that induce fibroblasts to reproduce and CLASSIFICATION Localized scleroderma is distinct from systemic scleroderma and rarely progresses to systemic disease. The category of JLS includes several subtypes differentiated by both the distribution of the lesions and the depth of involvement (Tables 201.2 and 201.3). Up to 15% of children have a combination of two or more subtypes. EPIDEMIOLOGY Juvenile scleroderma is rare, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 100,000 children. Localized scleroderma (LS) is much more common than sys- temic sclerosis (SSc) in children, by a 10:1 ratio, with linear scleroderma being the most common subtype. LS is predominantly a pediatric con- dition, with 65% of patients diagnosed before age 18 years. After age 8 years the female/male ratio for both LS and SSc is approximately 3:1, whereas in patients younger than 8 years, the prevalence is equal. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Localized Scleroderma The onset of scleroderma is generally insidious, and manifestations vary according to disease subtype. The initial skin manifestations of localized disease usually include erythema or a bluish hue seen around an area of waxy induration; subtle erythema may be the only presenting Table 201.1 SUBTYPE Diffuse cutaneous (dc) Clinical Subtypes of Systemic Sclerosis: Associated Organ Manifestations and Autoantibody Association ORGAN SYSTEM ORGAN SYSTEM FEATURES Skin Thickness proximal to elbows and knees Rapid progressive thickening ANTIBODY ASSOCIATION Topoisomerase (Scl-70) RNA Polymerase III U3-RNP (fibrillarin) Cardiac Limited cutaneous (Ic) Renal Pulmonary Skin Gastrointestinal Overlap syndrome Pulmonary Skin Musculoskeletal Cardiac Renal Pulmonary Gastrointestinal Congestive heart failure Conduction abnormalities Scleroderma renal crisis Interstitial lung disease Thickness limited to distal extremities (and face) Restricted and nonprogressive thickening Esophageal dysmotility Gl strictures Malabsorption Pulmonary arterial hypertension Either dcSSc or IcSSc pattern Skin manifestations of other CTD, such as Gottron papules (DM) and malar rash (SLE) Arthritis Myositis Can have any of the dcSSc or IcSSc manifestations Additional organ involvement in association with other CTD feature, such as lupus nephritis Centromere Th/To PM-Scl U1-RNP Ku

LS varies in size from a few centimeters to the entire length of the extrem- ity, with varying depth. Patients may present with arthralgias, syno- vitis, or flexion contractures (Fig. 201.3). Children also experience limb-length discrepancies as a result of growth impairment caused by involvement of muscle and bone. Children with en coup de sabre may have symptoms unique to central nervous system (CNS) involvement, such as seizures, hemifacial atrophy, ipsilateral uveitis, and learning/ behavioral changes (Fig. 201.4). Up to 25% of children with LS have extracutaneous manifestations, most frequently arthritis (47%) in lin- ear disease and neurologic symptoms (17%) associated with en coup Systemic Scleroderma Soc is a severe disease in children, starting with an insidious onset fol- lowed by a prolonged course characterized by periods of remission and exacerbation, commonly resulting in chronic disability and death, with a 5-year mortality rate of 7.5%. The skin manifestations of SSc include an early phase of edema that spreads proximally from the dorsum of the hands and fingers and includes the face. An eventual decrease in edema is followed by indura- tion and fibrosis of skin, ultimately resulting in loss of subcutaneous fat, sweat glands, and hair follicles. Later, atrophic skin becomes shiny and waxy in appearance. As lesions spread proximally, flexion contractures develop at the elbows, hips, and knees associated with secondary mus- cle weakness and atrophy. In the face, this process results in a small oral stoma with decreased mouth aperture. Skin ulceration over pressure points, such as the elbows, may be associated with subcutaneous calci- fications. Severe Raynaud phenomenon (RP; Fig. 201.5) causes ulcer- ation of the fingertips with subsequent loss of tissue pulp and tapered fingers (sclerodactyly) (Fig. 201.6). Resorption of the distal tufts of the distal phalanges may occur (acroosteolysis). Hyperpigmented postin- flammatory changes surrounded by atrophic depigmentation give a salt-and-pepper appearance to skin. Over years, remodeling of lesions sometimes results in focal improvement in skin thickening. Pulmonary disease is the most common visceral manifestation of SSc and includes both arterial and interstitial involvement (alveolitis). Symp- toms range from asymptomatic disease to exercise intolerance, dyspnea at

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a poor prognostic sign, developing because of lung disease or independently as part of the vasculopathy. Clinical manifestations of pulmonary arterial hypertension in children appear late in the course, are subtle, and include cough and dyspnea on exertion. Pulmonary evaluation should include pulmonary function tests (PFTs) such as diffusion capacity of carbon mon- oxide (DLco), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and high-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT). PFTs reveal decreased vital capacity and decreased DLco, whereas neutrophilia or eosinophilia on BAL suggests active alveolitis. Chest CT is much more sensitive than chest radiographs, which are often normal, showing typical basilar ground-glass abnormali- ties, reticular linear opacities, nodules, honeycombing, and mediastinal Gastrointestinal tract disease is seen in 25% of children with SSc. Common manifestations include esophageal and intestinal dysmotility resulting in dysphagia, reflux, dyspepsia, gastroparesis, bacterial over- growth, dilated bowel loops and pseudoobstruction, and dental caries, as well as malabsorption and failure to thrive. Renal arterial disease can cause chronic or severe episodic hypertension; unlike adult disease, renal Fig. 201.6 Sclerodactyly and finger ulcerations in a patient with sys- temic sclerosis who is poorly compliant with treatment. crisis is rare. Cardiac fibrosis is associated with arrhythmias, ventricular hypertrophy, and decreased cardiac function. Mortality from JSSc is usu- ally a result of cardiopulmonary disease. A scoring system helps identify the severity of the multiorgan involvement (Table 201.4).

Raynaud Phenomenon Raynaud phenomenon is the most frequent initial symptom in pediatric SSc, present in 70% of affected children months to years before other manifestations and seen in nearly all over the course of the disease. RP refers to the classic triphasic sequence of blanching, cyanosis, and ery- thema of the digits induced by cold exposure and/or emotional stress (see Fig. 201.5). RP is typically independent of an underlying rheumatic disease (Raynaud disease) but can result from rheumatic diseases such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and mixed con- nective tissue disease (Fig. 201.7). The color changes are brought about by (1) initial arterial vasoconstriction, resulting in hypoperfusion and pallor (blanching), (2) venous stasis (cyanosis), and (3) reflex vasodila- tion caused by the factors released from the ischemic phase (erythema). The color change is classically reproduced by immersing the hands in iced water and reversed by warming. During the blanching phase, there is inadequate tissue perfusion in the affected area, associated with pain and paresthesias and resulting in ischemic damage only when associated with a rheumatic disease. The blanching usually affects the distal fingers but may also involve thumbs, toes, ears, and tip of the nose. The affected area is usually well demarcated and uniformly white. Digital ulcers asso- ciated with RP are indicative of underlying rheumatic disease. Raynaud disease often begins in adolescence and is character- ized by symmetric occurrence, the absence of digital ulcers, tissue necrosis and gangrene, and the lack of manifestations of an under- lying rheumatic disease. Children have normal nail fold capillaries (absence of periungual telangiectasias). RP should be distinguished from acrocyanosis and chilblains. Acrocyanosis is a vasospastic dis- order resulting in cool, painless, bluish discoloration in the hands and feet despite normal tissue perfusion. It may be exacerbated by stimulant medications used to treat attention-deficit disorder. Chil- blains is a condition with episodic color changes and the develop- ment of nodules related to severe cold exposure and spasm-induced vessel and tissue damage; it has been associated with SLE and is also referred to as lupus pernio, but the majority of children with chil- blains do not have lupus. DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of JLS is based on the distribution and depth of charac- teristic lesions. Biopsy is helpful to confirm the diagnosis. The diagno- sis of JSSc requires proximal sclerosis/induration of the skin and the presence of 2 of 20 minor criteria (see Table 201.3). DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The most important condition to differentiate from JLS is JSSc. Contrac- tures and synovitis from juvenile arthritis can be differentiated from those caused by LS by the absence of skin changes. Other conditions to consider include chemically induced scleroderma-like disease, diabetic cheiro- arthropathy, pseudoscleroderma, and scleredema. Pseudoscleroderma comprises a group of unrelated diseases characterized by patchy or diffuse cutaneous fibrosis without the other manifestations of scleroderma. These include phenylketonuria, syndromes of premature aging, and localized idiopathic fibrosis. Scleredema is a transient, self-limited disease of both children and adults that has sudden onset after a febrile illness (especially streptococcal infections) and is characterized by patchy sclerodermatous lesions on the neck and shoulders and extending to the face, trunk, and arms. Laboratory Findings No laboratory studies are diagnostic of either localized or systemic scleroderma. Although the results of complete blood counts, serum chemistry analyses, and urinalysis are normal, children may have elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, eosinophilia, or hypergam- maglobulinemia, all of which normalize with treatment. Elevations of muscle enzymes, particularly aldolase, can be seen with muscle

Patients with JSSc may have anemia, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia and autoantibodies (ANA, anti-Scl-70). Imaging studies delineate the affected area and can be used to follow disease progres- sion. MRI is useful in en coup de sabre and Parry-Romberg syndrome (facial hemiatrophy) for determination of CNS or orbital involvement. Infrared thermography uses the temperature variation between areas of active and inactive cutaneous disease to help differentiate active dis- ease from damage. The role of ultrasound to examine lesion activity is evolving. HRCT, PFTs, echocardiography, and manometry are useful tools for diagnosing and monitoring visceral involvement in JSSc. TREATMENT Treatment for scleroderma varies according to the subtype and sever- ity. Superficial morphea may benefit from topical corticosteroids or ultraviolet therapy. For lesions involving deeper structures, sys- temic therapy is recommended. A combination of methotrexate and corticosteroids is effective in treating ILS by preventing lesion exten- sion and resulting in significant skin softening and improved range of motion of affected joints. The Childhood Arthritis and Rheuma- tology Research Alliance (CARRA) consensus treatment plans for JLS include (1) weekly subcutaneous (SC) methotrexate at 1 mg/kg (maximum dose 25 mg); (2) weekly SC methotrexate (1 mg/kg; max 25 mg) plus either 3 months of high-dose intravenous (IV) cortico- steroids (30 mg/kg; max 1,000 mg) for 3 consecutive days a month or weekly corticosteroids at the same dose for 3 months; or (3) high- dose daily oral corticosteroids (2 mg/kg/day, max 60 mg) with a slow taper over 48 weeks (Fig. 201.8). Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and abatacept have shown promise as second-line agents for recalcitrant

disease. Physical and occupational therapy are important adjuncts to pharmacologic treatment. Eosinophilic fasciitis often responds well to corticosteroids and methotrexate. Close follow-up is necessary in LS given high rates of relapse-up to 40%. Treatments for JSSc target specific disease manifestations (Tables 201.5 and 201.6). RP is treated with cold avoidance, and pharmaco- logic interventions are reserved for severe disease. Calcium channel blockers (nifedipine 30-60 mg sustained-release form daily; amlo- dipine 2.5-10 mg daily) are the most common pharmacologic inter- ventions. Additional potential therapies for RP include losartan, prazosin, bosentan, and sildenafil. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril, enalapril) are recommended for hyper- tension associated with renal disease. Methotrexate or MMF may be beneficial for skin manifestations. Cyclophosphamide and MMF are used to treat pulmonary alveolitis and prevent fibrosis. Corti- costeroids should be used cautiously in SSc because of an associa- tion with renal crisis. Adults with SSc have been successfully treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide, antithymocyte globulin, and autologous stem cell transplantation. Systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease has been managed with nintedanib, a tyro- sine kinase inhibitor, which has antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effects. Nintedanib combination therapy with MMF is also effective as an initiation therapy or when escalation of therapy is needed. The treatment of RP begins with avoiding cold stimuli, using hand and foot warmers, and avoiding carrying bags by their handles (impairs circulation). Nifedipine (10-20 mg three times daily-adult Chapter 201 • Scleroderma and Raynaud Phenomenon 1513 dose) reduces, but does not eliminate, the number and severity of episodes. Side effects include headache, flushing, and hypotension. Topical nitrates may result in digital vasodilation and may reduce the severity of an episode. PROGNOSIS JLS is ultimately generally self-limited, with the initial inflammatory stage followed by a period of stabilization and then softening, for an average disease duration of 3-5 years, although there are reports of active disease lasting up to 20 years. Prolonged disease activity is associated primarily with linear and deep disease subtypes. JLS. especially linear and deep subtypes, can result in significant mor- bidity, disfigurement, and disability as a result of joint contractures, muscle atrophy, limb shortening, facial asymmetry, and hyperpig- mentation and hypopigmentation. Death from an en coup de sabre lesion with progressive neurologic decline has been reported. JSSc has a more variable prognosis. Although many children have a slow, insidious course, others demonstrate a rapidly progressive form with early organ failure and death. Skin manifestations report- edly soften years after disease onset. Overall, the prognosis of JSSc is better than that of the adult form, with 5-, 10-, and 15-year sur- vival rates, respectively, in children of 89%, 80-87%, and 74-87%. The most common cause of death is heart failure caused by myocar- dial and pulmonary fibrosis. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography.

Chapter 202 Behçet Disease Seza Ozen Behçet disease (BD) is classified as a primary multisystem variable ves- sel vasculitis because of the involvement of any size and type (arterial, venous) of blood vessel. BD is probably underdiagnosed in children as a result of the eterogeneity in clinical features, the large spectrum of differential diseases, and lack of specific tests. Originally described with recurrent oral ulcerations, uveitis, and skin abnormalities, the BD spectrum is much broader. EPIDEMIOLOGY BD has a high prevalence in countries along the Silk Road, extend ing from Japan to the Eastern Mediterranean. It is increasingly recognized among people of European ancestry as well. BD has a prevalence of 5-7 per 100,000 adults. The increased disease rec- ognition might have had a role in the rising prevalence of BD as well as the migrations of the 20th century. Prevalence in children is probably not more than 10% of the adult counterparts in Eastern Mediterranean countries; boys and girls are equally affected. A fam- ily history of BD is present in approximately 20% of the cases. Onset in children is usually 8-12 years of age. Newborns of affected moth- ers have demonstrated symptoms of BD. ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS The etiology of BD is unknown. It is a polygenic disorder with auto- inflammatory features. The autoinflammatory nature of BD is sug- gested by its episodic nature, the prominent innate immune system activation, the absence of identifiable autoantibodies, and the co- association with the MEFV gene. However, there is evidence support- ing the role of the adaptive immune system as well. BD has also been considered to be an MHC-I-opathy because of the strong association with HLA-B51. Genetic contribution to BD is evident through this well-known association with HLA-B5101, the familial cases, the sib- ling and twin recurrence rate, the specific frequency of the disease among people along the Silk Road, evidence for genetic anticipation, and genome-wide analysis. Genome-wide analysis studies among Turkish and Japanese BD patients confirm the marked association with HLA-B5101. Other significant associations include interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-23R/IL-12Rßz genes. Other possible susceptibility loci demonstrate associations with STAT4 (a transcription factor in a signaling pathway related to cytokines such as IL-12, type I inter- ferons, and IL-23) and ERAP1 (an endoplasmic reticulum-expressed 

aminopeptidase that functions in the processing of peptides onto major histocompatibility complex class 1). An infectious agent may be responsible for inducing the aberrant innate immune system attacks in the genetically predisposed host. A number of infectious agents have been implicated and include strep- tococci and herpes simplex virus type 1. A microbiome study in BD proposed a distinct salivary signature. BD has some genetic and immune similarities to periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome and recurrent aphthous stomatitis, suggesting a spectrum of these disorders. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS The course of BD is characterized by exacerbations and remissions. There is marked heterogeneity in disease manifestations. The mean age of the first symptom is between 8 and 12 years. The most frequent initial symptom is a painful oral ulcer (Fig. 202.1). The oral ulcers are often recurrent, may be single or multiple, range from 2 to 10 mm, and may be in any location in the oral cavity. They are often very painful. The oral ulcers last 3-10 days and heal without scarring. In contrast, the genital ulcers heal with scars. Genital scars are noted in 60-85% of the patient, usually occur after puberty, and are seen on the labia, scrotum, penis, or anal area. Another key feature of BD that has significant morbidity is the bilateral eye involvement seen in 30-60% of pediatric patients. The main symptoms of anterior uveitis are blurred vision, redness, periorbital or global pain, and photophobia. Although it is often in the form of panuveitis, anterior uveitis may be seen in females. Uveitis in general is more common in males. Vitritis and retinal vasculitis are the most prominent features of posterior involvement. Complications of uveitis include blindness (unusual with treat- ment), glaucoma, and cataracts. Retinal vasculitis, retinal detach- ment, and retrobulbar neuritis (optic neuritis) are less common eye manifestations of BD. The skin lesions are the third most common symptom of BD. They range from erythema nodosum (seen in approximately 50% of patients) to papulopustular acneiform lesions (85%), folliculitis, purpura, and ulcers. Pathergy (seen in 50%) is another skin feature associated with BD and is a pustular reaction occurring 24-48 hours after a sterile needle puncture or saline injection; it is not pathog- nomonic of BD. The vasculitis of BD involves both arteries and veins, thrombosis and aneurysm formation, occlusions, or stenosis in arteries of any size. In children, deep venous thrombosis of the lower limbs is the most frequent vasculitic feature. If the hepatic vein is thrombosed, Budd-Chiari syndrome may occur. Pulmonary artery aneurysms Fig. 202.1 A deep aphthous ulcer in a patient with Behçet disease. Chapter 202 • Behçet Disease 1515 are the most severe feature of pediatric BD, associated with the highest mortality. Coronary artery aneurysms may confuse BD with Kawasaki or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) disease. Microvascular involvement may be noted in the nail bed capillaries. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations (approximately 10%) in children include meningoencephalitis (headache, menin- gismus, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis), encephalomyelitis, pseu- dotumor cerebri, dural sinus thrombosis, and organic psychiatric disorders (psychosis, depression, dementia). Dural sinus thrombo- sis is the most common CNS manifestation in children. Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement (seen in 10-30%) manifests with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal ulcerations, most often in the ileocecal region. Gastrointestinal BD may be difficult to distinguish from inflammatory bowel disease. Oligoarticular arthritis/arthralgia is present in >50% of patients and can be recur- rent, but is nondeforming. Other rare manifestations include orchi- tis, renal vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, or amyloidosis and cardiac involvement. The International Study Group for Behçet Disease (1SG) criteria used to be the most widely used and require the presence of oral ulcers (at least 3 times per year) along with two other major fea- tures, including genital ulcers, a positive pathergy test, uveitis, and the characteristic skin lesions. If only one of the criteria is present along with oral ulcerations, the term incomplete or partial Behçet disease is applied. The revised International Criteria for Behçet Dis- ease (ICBD) have been reported to have a much better performance than the 1990 ISG criteria. Additional classification criteria for children have been suggested by the use of an international prospective observational cohort. According to these criteria, BD is diagnosed when three of the following criteria are present: recurrent oral aphthosis, genital ulcers, skin involvement (necrotic folliculitis, acneiform lesions, erythema nodosum), ocu- lar involvement, neurologic involvement, and vascular involvement (venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial aneurysm). These criteria performed better than the ISG criteria in the pediatric cohort (Table 202.1). There are no specific laboratory tests. Acute-phase reactants are often mildly elevated. The diagnosis relies on the constellation of symp- toms and excluding other causes. Hughes-Stovin syndrome is characterized by thrombophlebitis and multiple bronchial or pulmonary artery aneurysms.

1516 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) process is regarded as a clinical variant of BD (partial or incomplete) but without ulcerations. TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS Azathioprine is highly recommended to treat inflammatory eye disease. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment and inter- feron (IFN)-a should be considered for refractory eye disease. For oral and genital ulcers, topical treatment and colchicine are recom- mended (sucralfate, corticosteroids). Apremilast, an oral phospho- diesterase-4 inhibitor, is effective in treating the oral ulcers of BD. In patients without major organ involvement, colchicine significantly improves oral and genital ulcers, skin features, and disease activ- ity. There is no evidence-based treatment for GI disease, but 5-ASA derivatives, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and anti-TNF agents have been recommended. For CNS disease and venous thrombosis, cor- ticosteroids, azathioprine, and anti-TNF agents are recommended. Patients treated with anti-TNF drugs have had persistent responses in 90%, 89%, 100%, and 91% of patients with resistant mucocuta- neous, ocular, GI, and CNS involvement, respectively. There is no consensus about the benefit of anticoagulation in the management of vein thrombosis in BD. In patients with pulmonary arterial or cardiac involvement, cyclo- phosphamide is typically used initially. Mortality in children with BD is low except for the pulmonary aneu- rysms. However, BD is a chronic disease associated with significant morbidity. Early diagnosis and effective treatment improve the out- come of BD.

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS The etiology of Sjögren syndrome is complex and includes genetic predisposition and possibly an infectious trigger. Lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrate salivary glands, forming distinct periductal and periacinar foci that become confluent and may replace epithelial struc- ture. Several genes regulating apoptosis influence the chronicity of lymphocytic infiltration. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS International classification criteria have been developed for the diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome in adult patients, but these criteria apply poorly to children. Although diagnostic criteria in children have been proposed, they have not been validated (Table 203.1). Recurrent parotid gland enlargement and parotitis are the most common manifestations in children (>70%), whereas sicca syn- drome (dry mouth, painful mucosa, halitosis, widespread den- tal caries) predominates in adults. Children tend to have a higher prevalence of systemic symptoms, including fevers and adenopa- thy, compared to adults. In a cross-sectional study of children with Sjögren syndrome, manifestations included recurrent parotitis (72%), sicca symptoms (38%), polyarthritis (18%), vulvovaginitis (12%), hepatitis (10%), Raynaud phenomenon (10%), fever (8%), renal tubular acidosis (9%), lymphadenopathy (8%), and central nervous system (CNS) involvement (5%). Chapter 203 Sjögren Syndrome C. Egla Rabinovich Sjögren syndrome is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by progressive lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration of the exocrine glands, especially salivary and lacrimal (parotid being prototypical), with potential for systemic manifestations. It is rare in children and has classic symptoms of dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and dry mouth (xerostomia). EPIDEMIOLOGY Sjögren syndrome typically manifests at 35-45 years of age, with 90% of cases among females, but it is underrecognized in children because symptoms often start in childhood. The mean age at diag- nosis in children is 9-10 years; 75% are female. The disease can The duca damn occur as an isolated disorder, referred to as primary Sjögren syn- drome (sicca complex), or as a secondary Sjögren syndrome in association with other rheumatic disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, or mixed connective tissue Table 203.1 Proposed Pediatric Criteria for Diagnosis of Sjögren Syndrome (SS) JUVENILE SS CLINICAL SYMPTOMS 1.

Subjective symptoms of xerostomia complaints are relatively rare in juvenile cases, perhaps indicating that Sjögren syndrome is a slowly progressive disease; however, increased dental caries is seen clinically in children. Serologic markers (antinuclear antibod- ies [ANAs], antibodies to Ro [SSA] and La [SSB]) and articular manifestations are significantly more common in adults. Reported frequencies of ANAs and SSA and SSB antibodies in children are 78%, 75%, and 65%, respectively, with rheumatoid factor present in 67%. Additional clinical manifestations from a variety of organ involvement patterns include a decreased sense of smell; hoarse- ness; chronic otitis media; leukocytoclastic vasculitis (purpura); and internal organ exocrine disease involving the lungs (diffuse interstitial lymphocytosis), pancreas, hepatobiliary system, gastro- intestinal tract, kidneys (renal tubular acidosis), musculoskeletal (arthritis and arthralgia), hematologic (cytopenias), peripheral ner- vous system (sensory and autonomic neuropathy), and CNS (optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, meningoencephalitis). Nonexocrine disease manifestations of Sjögren syndrome may be related to inflammatory vascular disease (skin, muscle and joints, serosal surfaces, CNS, peripheral nervous system), noninflammatory vascular disease (Raynaud phenomenon), mediator-induced disease (hematologic cytopenias, fatigue, fever), and autoimmune endocri- nopathy (thyroiditis). DIAGNOSIS Clinical presentation of recurrent parotitis and/or recurrent parotid gland swelling in a child or adolescent is characteristic and should raise the suspicion for Sjögren syndrome. The diagnosis is based on clinical features supported by biopsy of salivary or parotid glands demonstrating foci of lymphocytic infiltration, the current gold standard for diagnosis. Children are more likely to have normal minor salivary gland but abnormal parotid gland biopsies. Support- ing laboratory abnormalities include cryoglobulinemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypergammaglobulinemia, positive rheumatoid factor, and presence of SSA and SSB antibodies. The Schirmer test detects abnormal tear production (≤5 mm of wetting bis filter gret strip in danute, Special yes i cOnjestin and corneal cells. Imaging studies, including MRI, technetium (%)mTc) scintigraphy, parotid ultrasound, and sialography, are use- ful in the diagnostic evaluation for Sjögren syndrome (Fig. 203.1). DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The differential diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome in children includes juvenile recurrent parotitis, characterized by intermittent unilateral parotid swelling typically lasting only a few days; it is frequently asso- ciated with fever and may undergo remission with puberty. Unlike in Sjögren syndrome, there is a male predominance, juvenile recur- rent parotitis is seen in the younger children (3-6 years), and there is a lack of focal lymphocytic infiltrates on biopsy. Other conditions in the differential diagnosis include eating disorders, infectious parotitis (mumps, streptococcal and staphylococcal infections, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, parainfluenza, influenza enterovirus), and local trauma to the buccal mucosa. Rarely, polycystic parotid disease, tumors, and sarcoidosis may present with recurrent parotid swelling. Chapter 203 • Sjögren Syndrome 1517 Fig. 203.1 T2-weighted MRI of a child with Sjögren syndrome showing parotitis (arrows). In these conditions, sicca complex, rash, arthralgia, and ANAs are usu- ally absent. TREATMENT Symptomatic treatment of Sjögren syndrome includes the use of artifi- cial tears, massage of the parotids, oral lozenges, and fluids to limit the damaging effects of decreased secretions. Corticosteroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and hydroxychloroquine are among the more commonly used agents for treatment, with reports of methotrexate and etanercept used for treatment of arthritis. Stronger immunosuppres- sive agents, such as cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide, are reserved for severe manifestations (e.g., lung involvement) and life-threatening complications. COMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS The symptoms of Sjögren syndrome develop and progress slowly. Diminished salivary flow typically remains constant for years. Because monoclonal B-lymphocyte disease originates chiefly from lymphocytic foci within salivary glands or from parenchymal internal organs, there is increased risk for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Maternal Sjögren syndrome can be an antecedent to neonatal lupus syndrome (see Chapter 199.1). Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. 

1530 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) Chapter 205 Interferonopathies Sara E. Sabbagh and James W. Verbsky Type I interferonopathies refer to a group of inherited autoinflam- matory disorders that are characterized by dysregulation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway (Table 205.1). Type I interferonopathies were recognized when a report described the phenotypic overlap between Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) encephalopathy, congenital viral infections, and monogenic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The clinical similarities of these diseases stimulated the theory of a shared pathologic mechanism. Pathogenic variants involved in type I IFN sig- naling were identified to be causative for AGS and monogenic forms of SLE. Several other novel monogenic disorders with aberrant IFN signaling have been identified. Type I IFNs are ubiquitously expressed inflammatory polypep- tides that are induced by microbial and viral nucleic acids. During viral replication, accumulation of viral nucleic acids is sensed by several different cellular mechanisms, which leads to downstream IFN production (Fig. 205.1). Type I IFNs are released from the cell and bind to IFN receptors (IFNRs) through autocrine and paracrine action. The IFNR then activates signal translation through Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK- STAT) pathways, which promotes the expression of IFN-simulated genes (ISGs), which stops cell replication and protein translation of the infected cell. There are several molecular mechanisms that lead to altered regulation of IFN signaling: (1) loss-of-function variants of genes that encode enzymes responsible for DNA or DNA-RNA hybrid molecule degradation; (2) variants that lead to constitutive activation or reduction of the activation threshold of intracytosolic nucleic acid sensors; (3) gain-of-function variants of positive IFN signaling regulators; (4) loss-of-function variants of negative IFN signaling regulators; and (5) proteasomal dysfunction leading to the unfolded protein response and downstream IFN pathway activation. Examples of these altered molecular mechanisms and the associated Table 205.1 DISEASE Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) type 1 AGS2 Mutated Gene, Protein Function, Pattern of Inheritance, and Main Symptoms of Known Type 1 Interferonopathies GENE TREX-1 PROTEIN FUNCTION 3-5' DNA exonuclease INHERITANCE AR and AD SYMPTOMS Classical AGS RNASEH2B Components of RNase H2 complex.

P indicates phosphorylation. genetic variants are depicted in Figure 205.1. Each genetic variant that leads to dysregulation of IFN signaling is causative of a unique clinical syndrome or subtype of a clinical syndrome that has been classified as a type I interferonopathy. Despite some disease hetero- geneity, interferonopathies have a characteristic clinical phenotype, which may include recurrent fevers, early onset of skin vasculopa- thy with chilblains, livedo reticularis, panniculitis, lipodystrophy, interstitial lung disease with fibrosis, and encephalopathic CNS involvement (Fig. 205.2 and Table 205.2). AUTOINFLAMMATORY INTERFERONOPATHIES Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome AGS is a clinically heterogeneous disease with a spectrum of associ- ated phenotypes. AGS is characterized by an early-onset progressive encephalopathy with basal ganglia calcifications, leukoencepha- lopathy, and cerebral atrophy with elevated type I IFN cerebro- spinal fluid (CSF) levels and CSF pleocytosis. Cutaneous features, seen in about 30% of patients, include chilblains, or cold-induced acral dermatosis of the digits and auricles secondary to peripheral inflammatory vasculopathy. Other common manifestations include thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, transaminitis, psoriasis, interstitial lung disease, and intermittent fever. Most frequently, AGS has an infantile onset in which patients develop abrupt irri- tability, sterile pyrexias, and developmental regression within the first few months of life. Neurologic symptoms may include limb hypertonia with truncal hypotonia, dystonia, excessive startle, abnormal eye movements, epileptic seizures, and slowing of head growth. RNASEH2B variants are commonly seen in this context; however, variants of any associated AGS-related genes may present with this clinical scenario. AGS may also present prenatally with a striking similarity to transplacentally acquired infections (pseudo- TORCH), with onset of disease in utero. At birth, patients may have irritability, feeding difficulties, jitteriness, microcephaly, abnormal movements, epileptic seizures, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and liver dysfunction. This presentation is most frequently associated with TREX1 pathogenic variants and leads to profound develop- mental sequelae and increased risk of death in infancy. In both clinical presentations, neuroimaging shows a highly characteristic pattern of diffuse abnormal white matter, intracranial calcifica- tions, swelling of temporal or frontal lobes, and cerebral atrophy, similar to radiologic findings seen in congenital infections. Patients may also develop autoimmunity, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hypergammaglobulinemia, and hemolytic anemia. Rarely, AGS can have a later onset with abrupt profound neurologic regression after an extended period of normal development. There are seven recognized genetic variants and correspond- ing disease subtypes of AGS (AGS 1-7), all of which are respon- sible for RNA/DNA degradation or detection, resulting in type I

These include variants of 3'-5' DNA exonuclease-TREX1 (AGS1); ribonucleases including RNASEH2B (AGS2), RNASEH2C (AGS3), and RNASEH2A (AGS4); SAM and HD domain-containing deoxynucleoside triphosphate tri- phosphohydrolase 1-SAMHD1 (AGS5); adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1-ADARI (AGS6); and IFN-induced helicase C domain- containing protein-IFIH1 (AGS7). The majority of AGS subtypes are autosomal recessive; however, heterozygous gain-of-function variants can also occur in AGS1 and AGS6, and variants causing AGS7 are autosomal dominant. There are several manifestations that are strongly associated with distinct AGS subtypes. Bilateral striatal necrosis with severe dysto- nia is associated with variants in ADARI (AGS6), and spastic para- paresis has been associated with variants in ADAR1 (AGS6), IFIH1 (AGS7), and RNASEH2B (AGS). Variants involving SAMHD1 (AGS5) have the most variable phenotype with cutaneous involve- ment, glaucoma, progressive contractures, stroke, and cerebral aneurysms. Beyond the phenotype diversity between different AGS variants, there are descriptions of marked intrafamilial variation in siblings harboring identical homozygous variants, which raises questions regarding how environmental factors influence disease expression and penetrance. Spondyloenchondrodysplasia Spondyloenchondrodysplasia (SPENCD) is a rare autosomal reces- sive disorder best characterized as a skeletal dysplasia with sclerosis, enchondromas, short stature, platyspondyly, and irregularity of verte- bral end plates. Patients may also develop intracranial calcifications, spasticity, and a spectrum of autoimmunity that bears resemblance to SLE, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, glomerulone- phritis, malar rash, myositis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and auto- antibody positivity. Patients have also developed hypothyroidism, Raynaud phenomenon, Sjögren syndrome, and vitiligo. SPENCD is caused by variants of the ACP5 gene on chromosome 19p13, which encodes tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Loss of TRAP expression impairs inactivation of osteopontin (Opn), a protein involved in bone metabolism and Thl differentiation, via signaling through TLR9 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Increased lev- els of Opn thus leads to increased IFN-a production. STING-Associated Vasculopathy with Onset in Infancy STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) is a rare disorder that presents with systemic inflammation, fevers, and elevated inflammatory markers in the first months of life. a

Cutaneous involvement is characterized by vasculopathic rashes in acral areas (Fig. 205.3). These lesions present as violaceous plaques or nodules on the face, ears, or nose or as distal ulceration and may become necrotic. Lesional skin biopsy reveals leukocyto- clastic vasculitis, microthrombotic angiopathy, neutrophilia, and occasional immune complex deposition. As STING is expressed in alveolar macrophages, type 2 pneumocytes, and bronchial epi- thelium, patients with SAVI also develop pulmonary complica- tions. Paratracheal adenopathy, interstitial lung disease, and lung fibrosis have been described to a variable extent. Patients may also develop myositis, arthritis, arthralgia, oral ulcers, aphthosis, and nasal septum perforation. Low-titer autoantibodies (e.g., antinu- clear antibody, anticardiolipin antibodies, and antibodies against 32 glycoprotein 1) may be seen. Notably, the presence of antineu- trophil cytoplasmic antibodies (cANCA) may lead to misdiagnosis granulomatosis with polyangiitis. SAVI is caused by a dominant gain-of-function variant in TMEM173, which encodes the stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Working as both a direct cytosolic DNA sensor and as an adaptor protein in type I IFN signaling, STING mediates the production of IFN-a/ß. Chronic Atypical Neutrophilic Dermatosis with Lipodystrophy and Elevated Temperature/ Proteasome-Associated Autoinflammatory Syndromes Chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE) syndrome is a rare autoinflamma- tory disease caused by abnormal functioning of the proteasome- immunoproteasome. CANDLE presents in early infancy with fevers, systemic inflammation, and cutaneous involvement including neutrophilic dermatosis, annular erythema, violaceous eyelid swell- ing, and erythema nodosum-like panniculitis. Histology reveals a characteristic mononuclear interstitial infiltrate, which includes "immature" neutrophils in the dermis. Lipodystrophy, usually of the face, trunk, and upper limbs, begins in early childhood. Arthralgias, without radiographic evidence of arthritis, are common in children, and severe joint contractures may develop into adulthood. Acute attacks of inflammatory myositis, aseptic meningitis, sterile epidid- ymitis, conjunctivitis, nodular episcleritis, parotitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, carditis, and otitis have been reported. Autoimmunity can occur, including Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia and hypothy- roidism. Most commonly, CANDLE is due to loss-of-function vari- ants in the PSMB8 gene, which encodes the proteasome 5i subunit. More recently, variants in other genes encoding other proteasome- immunoproteasome subunits or the regulatory protein POMP have been discovered in patients with CANDLE syndrome. The detective proteasome function may lead to an accumulation of damaged pro- teins, resulting in cellular stress and type 1 IFN upregulation. ISG15 Deficiency/USP18 Deficiency Ubiquitin-like protein IN stimulated gene-15 (ISG15) deficiency has only been reported in a few individuals and leads to a pheno- type similar to AGS, with intracranial calcifications and seizures. ISG15 is an IFN-induced protein that that plays a central role in the host antiviral response, although, in humans, ISG15 deficiency does not cause an increased susceptibility to viral infection. Rather, the absence of intracellular ISG15 prevents the accumulation of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18), a potent negative regula- tor of IFN-a/ß signaling, which results in an unchecked IFN-a/ß 

response. Notably, loss-of-function recessive variants of USP18 have been reported in five patients, all of whom had neonatal demise soon after birth owing to the dysregulation of type 1 IN responses. Singleton-Merten Syndrome Singleton-Merten syndrome (SMS) is an autosomal dominant disor- der characterized by early-onset severe aortic and valvular calcifica- tion, dental anomalies, acro-osteolysis, osteoporosis, and glaucoma. There is a broad spectrum of disease with variable expressivity, and patients have been reported to have an SLE or AGS phenotype. SMS is caused by gain-of-function variants in IFIH1 and DDX58, which encode retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor family members melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and RIG-I, respectively. MDA5 and RIG-I are cytosolic pattern recogni- tion receptors that detect viral RNA and promote type I and III IFN expression. The phenotype variability of SMS suggests that other genetic and/or environmental factors may influence the clinical presentation. X-Linked Reticulate Pigmentary Disorder X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder (XLPDR) is an X-linked dominant disorder that manifests in the first few months of life in affected males with recurrent pneumonia, bronchiectasis, diar- rhea, and failure to thrive. Diffuse skin hyperpigmentation occurs in early childhood, and distinct facial features develop. Female car- riers typically exhibit only pigmentary changes along the lines of Blaschko. Hypohidrosis, corneal scarring, enterocolitis, and ure- thral strictures can develop. The defect in XLPDR is in an intron of the POLAl gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-a. Although this defect does not affect DNA replica- tion, it does appear to increase IN production and IFN-induced genes as well as NF-kB-induced genes in response to dsDNA, cyto- solic dsRNA, and TNF-a. DNAse |I Deficiency Deoxyribonucleases (DNAses) degrade double-stranded DNA molecules and exist in several forms. DNAse II degrades DNA contained in lysosomes, and recently deficiency of DNAse II was shown to cause a form of monogenic SLE. This autosomal reces- sive disease presents with severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly at birth that may resolve over time. In child- hood patients may then develop membranoproliferative glomeru- lonephritis, arthropathy, lipodystrophy, chilblain-like vasculitis, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Laboratory testing shows high titer ANA and dsDNA antibodies and high levels of serum IFNs and IFN-stimulated gene expression. In addition to DNAse II, there are two extracellular DNAses (DNAsel and DNAselL3) that do cause a monogenic form of SLE. Although these are likely to exhibit high IN signatures, no data are available on these two diseases, and thus they are not classically considered interferonopathies. AUTOIMMUNE INTERFERONOPATHIES Systemic Lupus Erythematosus There were descriptions of increased levels of IFN in the serum of patients with SLE. Further rationale for IN contributing to SLE pathogenesis was supported by observational studies of patients Chapter 205 • Interferonopathies 1535 who developed a lupuslike disease with autoantibody formation after treatment with IFN-a. Several groups showed that the major- ity of patients with SLE have an increased expression of type I IFN- regulated genes and that active SLE could be distinguished by an IFN-induced gene expression pattern. Many clinical features of SLE are associated with increased production of IFN, and a high IFN signature has been correlated with cytopenia, autoantibody forma- tion, and cutaneous disease activity. There are a large number of possible inducers of IFN production in SLE. Neutrophil extracel- lular TRAP formation, transposable elements, and immune com- plexes have all been associated with IN production in SLE patients. From a genetic standpoint, over 100 risk loci have been associated with SLE, many of which encode proteins with functions linked to type I IFN production or response. There are also several rare forms of monogenic SLE that are due to pathogenic variants involv- ing type I IFN signaling. Monogenic forms of SLE, including loss- of-function variants in DNAse II, DNASE1L3, and DNASE1, are classically grouped under the umbrella of interferonopathies and are characterized by typical SLE clinical manifestations with auto- antibody formation and immune complex deposition (see Chapter 199). Success of targeting the IN pathway has been documented in SLE, and multicenter phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials are currently underway in extrarenal disease. Juvenile Dermatomyositis Dermatomyositis has become recognized as a disease partly driven by aberrant IFN signaling. An elevated IN signature was first discovered in muscle tissue and later identified in peripheral blood cells of patients with adult and juvenile-onset dermatomyositis (DM, JDM). Subse- quently, multiple studies have shown an association between type I IFN in the circulation and disease activity in myositis. Targeting the IFN pathway has shown success in treatment of DM and JDM, and there are several ongoing clinical trials evaluating small-molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors for the treatment of dermatomyositis. Therapeutics Targeting the Interferon Pathway Treatments for interferonopathies has been historically empiric. Numerous immunosuppressive medications, including corticoste- roids and a variety of biologics, have been tried in case reports with variable results. However, because interteronopathies have a com- mon pathway involving IFN signaling, the use of small-molecule JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs) has gained interest as a targeted therapy for these disorders. Signaling through the IFN pathway involves JAKs that phosphorylate signal transducers and activators of tran- scription (STAT) proteins that then dimerize and enter the nucleus to drive transcription of IFN-stimulated genes. JAKinibs block acti- vation of JAK proteins and have been used to treat various auto- immune diseases. There is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of several JAKinibs, including tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; tofacitinib is also approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Clinical trials are underway to test the utility of JAKinibs in interferonopathies. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. 

1536 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) Chapter 206 Amyloidosis Deborah L. Stone and Karyl S. Barron Amyloidosis is the result of extracellular deposition of insoluble, fibrous amyloid proteins in various body tissues. It may be caused by a hereditary abnormality in an amyloidogenic protein or occur as a result of chronic inflammation associated with some infectious and rheumatologic diseases. ETIOLOGY Amyloidosis is a result of protein misfolding. These misfolded proteins aggregate and form insoluble fibrils that can affect the normal function of several vital organs. In the amyloidosis nomenclature, a distinction is made between amyloidosis that develops from pathogenic gene vari- ants in the amyloid fibril proteins (hereditary amyloidoses) and amy- loidosis associated with genetic mutation in nonamyloid proteins. The hereditary amyloidoses include diseases caused by pathogenic variants in the genes for transthyretin and apolipoprotein A and usually do not present in childhood. However, children may be affected by amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis, which develops in patients with chronic inflam- matory states. It is estimated that approximately 45% of all amyloid cases worldwide are AA amyloidosis. In the past, chronic infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy, and chronic osteomyeli- tis accounted for most cases of AA amyloidosis. Since the development of effective treatments for these infections, other causes of AA have become more common. Individuals with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and ankylosing spondylitis, as well as hereditary autoinflammatory dis- eases, have an increased risk for the development of AA amyloidosis. AA amyloidosis has also been associated with sarcoidosis, cystic fibro- sis, Crohn disease, malignancies (mesothelioma and Hodgkin disease), intravenous drug use disorders, and HIV infection. Approximately 6% of AA amyloidosis cases have no identified disease association. EPIDEMIOLOGY Only AA amyloidosis affects children in appreciable numbers. The factors that determine the risk for amyloidosis as a complication of inflammation are not clear. Many individuals with long-standing inflammatory disease do not demonstrate tissue amyloid deposi- tion, but some children with relatively recent onset of disease may develop amyloid. In developed countries, before therapy with disease- modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic agents was available, rheumatoid arthritis was the most common inflammatory disease associated with AA amyloidosis. Patients who had a long his- tory of severe and poorly controlled disease with extraarticular mani- festations were at the greatest risk of developing amyloidosis, and the median time from first symptoms of their rheumatic condition to the diagnosis of amyloidosis was 212 months. The use of DMARDs and biologic therapy has resulted in a sustained decline in the number of new cases of RA-associated amyloidosis. JIA may be associated with AA amyloidosis, with the highest preva- lence occurring in patients with systemic JIA, followed by those with polyarticular disease. AA amyloidosis has been observed in JIA patients as soon as 1 year after diagnosis. Before the availability of DMARDs and biologics, the prevalence of AA amyloidosis in JIA patients ranged from 1% to 10%. Higher prevalence was seen in Northern European patients, especially Polish patients, who had a prevalence of 10.6%; a lower prevalence was observed in North American patients. The rea- sons for this discrepancy are not completely understood, although it is speculated that selection bias, genetic background, and tendency toward earlier, more aggressive therapy in North Americans may have played a role. As with RA, the occurrence of new amyloid cases in patients with JIA has significantly decreased in the past 20 years because of the increased efficacy of treatment with DMARDs and The hereditary autoinflammatory diseases define a group of ill- nesses characterized by attacks of seemingly unprovoked recurrent inflammation without significant levels of either autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells, which are typically found in patients with auto- immune diseases. These attacks often appear to be initiated by stress, immunizations, or trauma. Common findings of autoinflammatory diseases include fevers, cutaneous rashes, arthritis, serositis, and ocu- lar involvement. The inflammatory attacks are accompanied by intense elevations in inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) and high levels of serum amyloid A (SAA). Amyloidosis AA is associated with some, but not all, hereditary auto- inflammatory diseases. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common of the Mendelian autoinflammatory diseases and is seen most frequently in the Armenian, Arab, Turkish, and Sephardic Jewish populations. FMF is an autosomal recessive disease that results from pathogenic variants in the MEFV gene, which encodes the pyrin protein. MEFV pathogenic variants affecting the M680 and M694 amino acid residues are associ- ated with early onset of symptoms, severe disease, and an increased risk of AA amyloidosis. Patients residing in Armenia, Turkey, and Arab countries have an increased risk of developing AA amyloidosis com- pared with patients with the same MEFV mutations living in North America. While one might assume that FMF patients who have fre- quent, severe attacks would be at the highest risk for the development of AA amyloidosis, this is not always the case. Some patients with a history of frequent attacks never develop amyloidosis, whereas others develop amyloidosis at an early age. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is associated with pathogenic variants in the TNFRSFIA gene, which encodes the 55-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) recep- tor protein (TNFR1). It is estimated that 14-25% of untreated patients with TRAPS will develop AA amyloidosis. The risk of amyloidosis appears to be greater among patients with cysteine pathogenic variants or the 150M pathogenic variant. These cysteine residues normally cre- ate disulfide bonds within the protein, and disruption of these bonds by amino acid substitutions is thought to interfere with protein folding. Pathogenic variants in the NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain con- taining 3) gene encoding the NLRP3 or cryopyrin protein cause three clinically distinct diseases or cryopyrinopathies: familial cold autoin- flammatory syndrome (FCAS, or NLRP3-AID mild), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS, or NLRP3-AID moderate), and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID, or NLRP3-AID severe), also known as chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome. Pathogenic variants in NLRP3 are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion or as de novo variants in patients with the most severe disease. A few patients have been found to carry somatic variants in NLRP3. FCAS is the least severe of the cryopyrinopathies and is rarely asso- ciated with AA amyloidosis. MWS presents with fevers, myalgias, arthralgias, urticarial-like rash, and progressive sensorineural hearing loss. AA amyloidosis is quite common in MWS, affecting up to one third of the patients. NOMID/CINCA is the most severe cryopyrinop- athy. NOMID patients have not developed AA amyloidosis as often as MWS patients, but this may be attributable to the fact that before the availability of effective treatments, 20% of NOMID patients died before reaching adulthood. Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) - mild (formally known as Hyper-IgD syndrome, or HIDS) is an autoinflammatory disease that presents in early childhood with high fevers, abdominal pain, lymph- adenopathy, and occasional rash. MVK-mild is an autosomal reces- sive disease that involves loss-of-function variants in the MVK gene that encodes the mevalonate kinase enzyme. Patients with MVK-mild retain a low level of enzyme activity, whereas patients with MVK- severe (mevalonic aciduria) have severe MVK variants that completely abolish enzyme activity, causing recurrent fevers, dysmorphic features, and developmental delays. Inflammatory markers are high during 

MVK-mild attacks and may remain elevated between attacks. AA amy- loidosis is rare in patients with MVK-mild but has been reported, most often associated with the V3771/I268T genotype. Although seen less frequently than in the hereditary periodic fever syndromes, AA amyloidosis occurs in an estimated 1% of U.S. patients and up to 3% of Northern European patients with Crohn disease. Con- versely, AA amyloidosis in patients with ulcerative colitis is extremely rare, with an estimated prevalence of 0.07%. Patients with Crohn dis- ease and AA usually have a long-standing history of aggressive, poorly controlled disease, although there are reports of amyloidosis in patients with well-controlled inflammatory markers. Thirty-six proteins have been identified as being amyloidogenic in humans, but most of these rarely cause disease during childhood. Transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis is an autosomal domi- nant disorder with variable penetrance and onset in the second to third decades of life. Manifestations include familial amyloidotic polyneu- ropathy, familial amyloid cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, and ocular disease. PATHOGENESIS The deposition of AA amyloid fibrils is a result of a prolonged inflam- matory state that leads to misfolding of the AA amyloid protein and deposition into tissues. The precursor protein of the fibrils in AA amy- loidosis is an apolipoprotein called serum amyloid A. SAA is expressed by three different genes on chromosome 11p15.1. SAAl and SAA2 are two isoforms that are acute-phase reactants synthesized by the liver. SAA is produced in response to proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and TNF-a, and can increase more than 1,000- fold during inflammation. It has been speculated that SAA has a role as a chemoattractant and in lipid metabolism. Supporting this theory is the finding that amyloid deposition occurs initially in organs that are major sites of lipid and cholesterol metabolism, such as the kidney, liver, and spleen. Approxi- mately 80% of secreted SAA1 and SAA2 is bound to lipoproteins. Usu- ally SAA secreted by the liver is completely degraded by macrophages. The secreted SAA protein is 104 amino acids in length and is primarily secreted in an a-helix structure. For reasons not completely under- stood, patients with AA amyloidosis have incomplete degradation and accumulation of intermediate SAA products. In these patients, SAA is transferred to the lysosome where the c-terminal portion of the 104-amino acid SAA protein is cleaved, allowing the remaining 66-76 amino acid proteins to fold into a -pleated sheet configuration. These cleaved fragments polymerize, form fibrils that are deposited in the extracellular space, and bind proteoglycans and other proteins such as serum amyloid P. These fibrils are resistant to proteolysis and deposit in organ tissues. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Although organ involvement may vary, AA amyloidosis most fre- quently affects the kidneys; 90% of patients have some degree of renal involvement. Unexplained proteinuria may be the presenting feature in some patients. Nephrotic syndrome and renal failure may develop if the underlying inflammatory condition is not well-controlled. Patients with higher SAA levels have a significantly higher risk of death than those with lower SAA levels. Gastrointestinal (GI) involve- ment is seen in approximately 20% of patients and usually manifests as chronic diarrhea, GI bleeding, abdominal pain, and malabsorption. When biopsied, the testes are frequently discovered to be involved (87%). Relatively uncommon findings associated with AA amyloidosis include anemia, amyloid goiter, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, adrenal involvement, and pulmonary involvement. The heart, tongue, and skin are rarely involved. DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of amyloidosis is established by a biopsy demonstrating amyloid fibril proteins in affected tissues. The tissues tested may include kidney, rectum, abdominal fat pad, and gingiva. Amyloid deposits are composed of seemingly homogeneous eosinophilic material that stains with Congo red dye and demonstrates the pathognomonic "apple-green Chapter 206 • Amyloidosis 1537 birefringence" in polarized light. Tissue staining and genetic testing are useful for diagnosing transthyretin amyloidosis. LABORATORY FINDINGS In the United States, specific laboratory testing is not commercially available for AA amyloid, but SAA levels are available in some other countries and can be monitored to guide response to treatment. TREATMENT There is no established therapy for AA amyloidosis, and thus the pri- mary approach is aggressive management of the underlying inflamma- tory or infectious disease. As newer therapies are developed to treat the underlying conditions, emerging evidence shows that the incidence of AA amyloidosis is decreasing. Colchicine is effective not only in con- trolling the attacks of FMF but also in preventing the development of amyloidosis associated with FMF. AA amyloidosis associated with other autoinflammatory diseases and chronic rheumatic diseases does not respond to colchicine. Biologic agents against proinflammatory cytokines used to treat RA, JIA, spondyloarthropathies, and the heredi- tary autoinflammatory diseases appear to decrease the risk of develop- ing AA amyloidosis and may even reverse the deposition of amyloid. The class of medications referred to as the TNF inhibitors have been paramount in the management of RA and other autoimmune diseases, and there are reports documenting the effectiveness of anti-TNF agents in blunting the progression of amyloidosis. Adverse eftects of anti-TNF medications include reactivation of tuberculosis and hepatitis B, and thus screening should be performed before instituting therapy. Cau- tion should be used in prescribing anti-TNF agents to patients with a history of heart failure or demyelinating disease, because their use may cause exacerbations of underlying cardiac and neurologic diseases. The IL-1 pathway is the target of three biologic medications used in autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. The available IL-1 antag- onists are anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist), rilonacept (soluble IL-1 receptor decoy), and canakinumab (long-acting fully humanized IgG, anti-IL-1ß monoclonal antibody). A trial of canakinumab in patients with colchicine-resistant FMF, MKD, and TRAPS showed that it was eftective in controlling and preventing flares. The vari- ous IL-1 inhibitors have been successful at slowing the progression of AA amyloidosis, and in some cases treatment results in regression of amyloid proteinuria. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, has been shown to attenuate experimental AA amyloid and to reverse AA amyloidosis complicating JIA and RA. A trial using eprodisate disodium in AA amyloid patients failed to meet its primary end-point of reducing pro- gression to end-stage renal disease and was halted in 2016. tion, which removes the source of mutated transthyretin molecules, tein, stabilize tetramers of the protein, or disrupt fibrils. PROGNOSIS End-stage renal failure is the underlying cause of death in 40-60% of patients with amyloidosis. According to a large-scale study of 374 patients with AA amyloidosis, the factors associated with a poor prog- nosis include older age, a lower albumin serum level, end-stage renal disease at baseline, and prolonged serum elevation of SAA. An elevated SAA value was the most powerful risk factor for end-stage renal disease and death from AA amyloidosis. PREVENTION The primary means of preventing AA amyloidosis is treatment of the underlying inflammatory or infectious disease, resulting in decreases in the level of SAA protein and the risk of amyloid deposition. Although the period of latency between the onset of inflammation from the underlying disease and the initial clinical signs of AA amyloidosis may vary and is often prolonged, progression of the amyloid depositions can be rapid.

1538 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) Chapter 207 Macrophage Activation Syndrome Rebecca Trachtman and Edward M. Behrens Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a potentially fatal compli- cation of rheumatic diseases thought to be caused by excessive activa- tion and expansion of macrophages and T cells. These events lead to an overwhelming inflammatory reaction, involving fever, hepatospleno- megaly, lymphadenopathy, cytopenias, liver dysfunction, and coagu- lopathy resembling disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Extreme hyperferritinemia is a characteristic laboratory feature that separates MAS from primary disease flare. Inflammatory infltrates composed predominantly of I' lymphocytes and hemophagocytic macrophages are commonly seen in the bone marrow; they are also found in the liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. These hemophagocytic macrophages can infiltrate most organs in the body. Both the systemic and local inflammation can cause severe organ dam- age, which can be life-threatening and progress to multiple organ fail- ure. The abundance of tissue macrophages exhibiting hemophagocytic activity in inflammatory lesions in MAS suggests that MAS is related to a group of histiocytic disorders collectively known as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). EPIDEMIOLOGY Although MAS can occur in many rheumatic diseases, it is seen most frequently in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and in its adult equivalent, adult-onset Still disease (AOSD). The reasons for this association remain unclear; elevated interleukin (IL)-18 may be a caus- ative factor. Approximately 7-17% of patients with SJIA develop severe disease, whereas more mild subclinical MAS may be seen in as many as 30% of patients with SJIA. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Kawasaki disease are other rheumatologic conditions in which MAS occurs somewhat more frequently than in other rheumatic diseases. In SLE, MAS occurs in approximately 1-9% of patients. MAS most often occurs subsequent to the onset of rheumatologic disease; MAS has also been known to occur at the initial presentation of a rheumatic illness. Approximately 23% of episodes of MAS have occurred at the onset of SJIA. MAS typically occurs in the setting of active primary rheumatic disease. However, it can occur despite good control of underlying rheumatic disease. Many cases occur in the set- ting of infections and/or modifications in drug therapy. Both of these triggers are possibly related to subsequent active rheumatic disease. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND OTHER HYPERINFLAMMATORY SYNDROMES The exact mechanisms behind MAS remain unclear; however, much has been extrapolated from the pathogenesis of primary HLH (pHLH). Consistent with parallels to pHLH, in MAS there is an abundance of interferon-gamma (IFN-y)-producing CD8+ T cells in inflammatory lesions. Further suggesting a role for T-cell-mediated inflammation, cyclosporine A, a therapeutic agent that acts predominantly on T cells, is very effective in the treatment of the majority of MAS patients. CXCL9, a biomarker of IFN-y activity, is also elevated in patients dur- ing an MAS episode. Cytotoxic function appears to be impaired in cer- tain subsets of SJIA patients, perhaps specifically in those at risk for MAS, although this finding has been inconsistent. Some studies have demonstrated an enrichment of heterozygous pathogenic variants in known pHLH genes in MAS populations, suggesting that hypomorphic lesions in cytolytic pathways may result in disease. Translational studies in SJIA patients suggest that elevated serum IL- 18 is a risk factor for the development of SJIA/MAS. A common link to the "IFN-y-centric" models is that IL-18 is perhaps most noted for its ability to stimulate IFN-y production by T cells and natural killer cells. In the case of MAS caused by activating pathogenic variants in the NLRC4 gene, IL-18 has been shown to be highly elevated, and case reports of IL-18 blockade leading to resolution of both disease and IFN-y activity suggest a causal link. Cytokine Storm A "cytokine storm" is the common pathophysiologic state in many hyperinflammatory diseases. There is increasing interest in the relative roles of cytokines in MAS pathophysiology, and the similarities and differences to HLH, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) related to SARS-CoV-2 virus, and sepsis. MAS belongs to a group of hemophagocytic disorders, which includes HLH. The current classification of histiocytic disorders distinguishes primary, or familial, HLH and secondary, or reactive, HLH (see Chapter 556.2). Clinically, they may be difficult to distinguish from each other. pHLH is a constellation of rare autosomal recessive immune disorders linked to genetic defects in various genes all affecting the cytolytic path- way. The clinical symptoms of pHLH usually become evident within the first months of life. Secondary HLH tends to occur in older children or adults. It may be associated with an identifiable infectious episode, most often Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. However, when EBV-associated HLH occurs as part of a genetic syn- drome, such as the X-linked proliferative disorders, it is more properly considered pHLH. The group of secondary hemophagocytic disorders also includes malignancy-associated HLH. Some consider MAS to be a form of secondary HLH, whereas others make a distinction and prefer the moniker "Rheuma-HLH" to separate MAS from other secondary HLH conditions. The distinction between primary and secondary HLH is becoming less distinct because of other genetic causes, some of which are associated with less severe and more distinct clinical presentations. Some of these may present later in life because heterozygous or com- pound heterozygous pathogenic variants in cytolytic pathway genes that confer a partial dominant negative effect on the cytolytic function. The exact relationship between HLH and MAS is an area of extensive investigation, and some rheumatologists believe that MAS should be categorized as secondary HLH occurring in a setting of a rheumatic disease (or MAS-HLH). Although there are multiple attempts to try to standardize the nomenclature for these various syndromes, at this point, best practice would be to use the term primary HLH for cases with known molecular diagnoses or a clear genetic component. For secondary cases, there is not yet a prescribed specific terminology, but inclusion of known secondary causes can add clarity to the specific syndromes being described (e.g., SJIA-MAS, EBV-HLH). Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Children may develop a postinfectious hyperinflammatory syndrome after SARS-CoV-2 virus exposure that bears some resemblance to MAS. Approximately 4-8 weeks after infection, children developed multiorgan dysfunction, frequently involving persistent fever, abdomi- nal pain, and rash, and sometimes accompanied by abnormal cardiac function or hypotension. Laboratory evaluation is significant for eleva- tion of markers of inflammation and sometimes hyperferritinemia, coagulopathy, and liver dysfunction. Similar to MAS, this phenom- enon occurred after infectious trigger, and cytokine storm has been invoked in multiple studies, especially involving IL-18, IL-10, IL-6, and the IFN-y-induced CXCL9. CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS The clinical findings in overt MAS are dramatic and often evolve rap- idly. High persistent fever, hepatosplenomegaly, generalized lymphade- nopathy, liver dysfunction, and changes in mental status are common. Coagulopathy resembling DIC can be associated with hemorrhagic 

skin rashes ranging from mild petechiae to extensive ecchymotic lesions. These can progress to epistaxis and hematemesis secondary to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Mental status changes, seizures, and coma are the most common manifestations of CNS disease. Cerebro- spinal fluid examination in these patients usually reveals pleocytosis with mildly elevated protein. Deterioration in renal function has been noted in several series and may be associated with particularly high mortality. Pulmonary infiltrates can occur, and hemophagocytic mac- rophages can be found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These clinical symptoms are associated with notable laboratory features. A precipitous fall in at least two of three blood cell lines (leukocytes, erythrocytes, or platelets) is one of the early findings, caused in part by increased destruction of cells by phagocytosis and consumption at inflammatory sites. Decreasing erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) despite persistently high CRP is another characteristic laboratory feature. This parallels hypofibrinogen- emia, likely secondary to fibrinogen consumption and liver dys- function. Prolonged prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times, fibrin degradation products, and moderate deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors are usually present as well. Liver involvement is common in MAS, and most patients develop marked hepatomegaly, and sometimes mild jaundice. Liver func- tion tests frequently reveal high serum transaminase activity and mildly elevated levels of serum bilirubin. Serum ammonia levels are typically normal or only mildly elevated. Additional laboratory findings in MAS include hypertriglyceridemia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Perhaps the most striking laboratory change in MAS is the eleva- tion of serum ferritin. Although diagnostic/classification criteria set levels of 500 ng/mL and 684 ng/mL as cutoffs for HLH and SJIA-MAS respectively, levels are often greater than 10,000 ng/mL. The reasons for this elevated ferritin are not clear and are likely multifactorial. Although extremely high ferritin is often a good serologic marker of HLH and MAS, high levels are not pathognomonic and can be seen in a wide vari- ety of conditions. Thus ferritin needs to be interpreted in the context of the other features of the disease to support a diagnosis. Further, serum ferritin is usually 60-80% glycosylated, whereas intracellular ferritin is not glycosylated. In hemophagocytic syndromes, the percentage of gly- cosylated ferritin in the serum is low, typically below 20%; assessment of glycosylated ferritin may also be a useful tool for MAS diagnosis. It has been recognized that as many as one third of patients with active SJIA may have mild subclinical MAS. These patients typically have moderate hyperferritinemia, highly increased CRP, moder- ately decreased hemoglobin, and relatively low platelet counts. These patients may also have mild hepatosplenomegaly and mildly elevated liver enzymes. Serum fibrinogen tends to remain in the normal range despite highly increased CRP. DIAGNOSIS Recognition of MAS is crucial, but early diagnosis is often difficult. There is no single clinical or laboratory feature that is specific for MAS, including hemophagocytosis, and many clinical features of MAS over- lap with those seen in the underlying rheumatic diseases. The MAS clinical presentation also overlaps with sepsis-like syndromes associ- ated with infection. This is further complicated by the fact that MAS may also be triggered by a flare of the underlying rheumatic disease or infection. In a patient with active underlying rheumatologic disease, persistent fevers and decrease in ESR and platelet count in combina- tion with increasing serum ferritin and persistently high CRP should raise suspicion for impending MAS. Increasing liver enzymes, aspar- tate aminotransferase in particular, is another characteristic laboratory change. The diagnosis of MAS might be confirmed by bone marrow biopsy, with the presence of increased hemophagocytosis. However, demonstration of hemophagocytosis may be limited by sampling error, particularly at the early stages of the syndrome. In such cases, additional staining of the bone marrow with anti-CD163 antibodies may be helpful. Features consistent with MAS include massive expan- sion of highly activated histiocytes. The diagnosis of MAS is supported by elevated levels of soluble IL2Ra and soluble CD163 in serum. Chapter 207 • Macrophage Activation Syndrome 1539 Table 207.1 The Classification Criteria for Macrophage Activation Syndrome in Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis A febrile patient with known or suspected systemic juvenile diopathic arthritis is classified as having macrophage activation syndrome if the following criteria are met: Ferritin >684 ng/mL and any two of the following: Platelet count ≤181 × 10%/L Aspartate aminotransferase >48 U/L Triglycerides > 156 mg/dL Fibrinogen ≤360 mg/dL Evidence is mounting that IFN-y is the pivotal cytokine in MAS; however, peripheral measurement of IFN-y can be difficult because of retention in tissues. Therefore the IFN-induced chemokine CXCL9 may be a more reliable serum biomarker of MAS. Although substantial elevation in the serum levels of soluble IL2Ra receptors and CXCL9 in an SJIA patient is highly suggestive of MAS, these assessments remain nonspecific, and elevation can be associated with some malignancies and viral infections, such as viral hepatitis. Striking clinical similarities between MAS and HLH have led some to advocate for the use of the HLH-2004 diagnostic guidelines devel- oped by the HLH Study Group of the International Histiocyte Society (see Chapter 556.2). However, the application of the HLH diagnos- tic criteria to SJIA patients with suspected MAS is problematic, both because there is significant overlap with common features of active rheumatic disease and because SJIA patients may reach some of the criteria only later in the clinical course. NK function testing as a means to assess cytotoxic activity is problematic, as defects in this pathway are only variably associated with SJIA and MAS. Criteria for the diagnosis of MAS complicating SJIA are noted in Table 207.1. In cross-validation analyses, the criteria revealed a sen- sitivity of 0.72-0.76 and a specificity 0.97-0.99. It should be noted that these criteria were developed for classification for studies and trials and were not optimized for clinical diagnostic purposes. One limitation of the MAS classification criteria is that background treat- ment with biologics might modify the clinical presentation of MAS. Although IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors effectively control the disease in the majority of SJIA patients, they do not provide full protection against MAS and may impede diagnosis. Furthermore, the MAS classifica- tion criteria are less likely to classify tocilizumab-treated patients as having MAS compared with historical controls or canakinumab- treated patients. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS It is most important to distinguish MAS from a flare of an underlying rheumatologic disease and from intercurrent infection. Further, one must consider other clinical entities associated with hyperferritinemia, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, cytopenias, or encephalopathy, specifically DIC, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and malignancy-associated HLH. Some other important differential diag- noses include sepsis and drug reactions; a thorough infectious workup is necessary for the majority of MAS patients. Hyperferritinemia is not specihc for hemophagocytic syndromes and may be observed in vari- ous liver and kidney diseases, hematologic malignancies, or conditions requiring chronic blood transfusions. TREATMENT MAS is still associated with high mortality rates; therefore prompt recognition and initiation of immediate therapeutic intervention are critical. To achieve rapid reversal of coagulation abnormalities and cytopenias, most clinicians start with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (30 mg/kg for three consecutive days) followed by 2 to 3 mg/kg/day in four divided doses. 

1540 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) If response to glucocorticoids is not satisfactory, cyclosporine A (2-7 mg/kg/day) is usually added to the treatment regimen based on several reports describing the rapid resolution of MAS features in response to this medication. Cyclosporine is preferentially used orally, and careful monitoring for toxicity is required, especially if it is administered intra- venously. In many patients, administration of cyclosporine A not only provides rapid control of symptoms but also avoids excessive use of steroids. Case reports support the use of tacrolimus as an alternative to cyclosporine A, as it is often effective and has a desirable safety profile. There is also reported efficacy with the use of anakinra for MAS. Because MAS episodes may be triggered by disease flare, biologics that neutralize IL-1 could extinguish the underlying inflammation driving the cytokine storm. There are several case reports and two case series of anakinra treat- ment for MAS with promising results, particularly when used in higher doses. However, in established SJIA, continuous treatment with standard doses of anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 biologic therapies does not absolutely protect against MAS even if the underlying disease responds well to the treatment. In the phase 3 clinical trial of canakinumab, IL-1 blockade did not confer full protection from MAS even in patients with fully controlled SJIA. These results suggest that IL-1 inhibition effectively treats MAS in many patients, but does not completely prevent the occurrence of MAS, particularly in the setting of viral infection in treated subjects. Intravenous immune globulin treatment has been successful in virus-associated reactive HH. Rituximab-a treatment that depletes B lymphocytes, the main type of cells harboring EBV virus-has been successfully used in EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disease and could be considered in EBV-driven MAS. If MAS remains active despite the use of corticosteroids, anakinra, and cyclosporine A, the HLH-2004 treatment protocol developed by the HLH Study Group of the International Histiocyte Society may be considered. In addition to steroids and cyclosporine A, this protocol includes etoposide (or VP16), a podophyllotoxin derivative that inhibits DNA synthesis by forming a complex with topoisomerase II and DNA. However, this pro- tocol is limited by the toxicity of etoposide and its likelihood of causing kidney and liver damage. In addition, severe bone marrow suppression, overwhelming infection, and death have been reported. The use of lower doses of etoposide (50-100 mg/m? range rather than 150 mg/m?, as sug- gested by the HLH-2004 protocol) has been advocated by some groups. It has also been suggested that antithymocyte globulin (ATG) might be a safer alternative to etoposide, particularly in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. ATG depletes both CD4* and CD8+ T cells through complement-dependent cell lysis. Mild depletion of mono- cytes is noted in some patients as well. Although this treatment was tol- erated well in reported cases, infusion reactions are frequently reported with the use of ATG, and adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources must be readily available it this treatment is used. Occasional reports describe successful use of cyclophosphamide to control MAS mainly in patients with SLE. The monoclonal antibody tocilizumab is very effective in treating SJIA. However, in a phase 3 clinical trial of tocilizumab in SJIA, several patients developed MAS. Similar to canakinumab, at the time of MAS presentation, underlying SJIA in most of these patients was well con- trolled. Furthermore, tocilizumab can cause normalization of some of the laboratory parameters of MAS, without actually altering the course of MAS activity itself, providing false reassurance of disease control. In a patient with an inflammasomopathy caused by gain-of-function pathogenic variants in NLRC4, administration of the recombinant IL-18BP resulted in rapid and sustained improvement, including the resolution of all MAS-like features. It remains unclear whether a simi- lar therapeutic intervention might be effective in MAS as well. Based on their essential roles in transmitting cytokine-induced signals, par- ticularly from IFN-y, the JAK/STAT pathways have become a target for pharmacologic manipulation in inflammatory diseases. Ruxolitinib, a potent inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, has been shown to ameliorate the disease-influencing patterns of JAK/STAT-dependent gene expression in animal models of pHLH, but it remains to be determined whether this treatment will be routinely effective in patients with MAS.

Newburger Kawasaki disease (KD), formerly known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome and infantile polyarteritis nodosa, is an acute febrile illness of childhood seen worldwide, with the highest incidence occurring in Asian children. KD is a systemic inflammatory disorder manifesting as a vasculitis with a predilection for the coronary arteries. Approximately 20-25% of untreated children develop coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs), including aneurysms, whereas <5% of children treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) develop CAA. Nonetheless, KD is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in most devel- oped countries, including the United States and Japan. ETIOLOGY The cause of KD remains unknown. Certain epidemiologic and clini- cal features support an infectious origin, including the young age- group affected; epidemics with wavelike geographic spread of illness; the self-limited nature of the acute febrile illness; and the clinical features of fever, rash, enanthem, conjunctival injection, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Further evidence of an infectious trigger includes the infrequent occurrence of the illness in infants <3 months old, pos- sibly the result of protective maternal antibodies, and the rarity of cases in adults, possibly the result of prior exposures with subsequent immunity. Furthermore, the number of hospitalizations per year for KD significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, both in Japan and the United States, possibly due to low circulating causative viruses. However, there are also features that are not consistent with an infectious origin; it is unusual to have multiple cases present at the same time within a family or daycare center. Furthermore, no single infectious etiologic agent has been successfully identified, despite an exhaustive search. Other environmental triggers such as airborne tox- ins and climate shifts have also been speculated to play a role. Genetic factors clearly influence the pathogenesis of KD, as evi- denced by the higher risk of KD in Asian children regardless of country of residence and in siblings and children of individuals with a history of KD. The concordance rate among identical twins is approximately 13%. Linkage studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identited signiticant potential associations between polymorphisms in the ITPKC gene, a T-cell regulator, with increased susceptibility to KD and more severe disease. Other candidate genes for KD identified by GWAS include CASP3, BLK, and FCGR2A. Lastly, multiple alleles in different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) regions have been reported EPIDEMIOLOGY For the majority of patients, KD is a disease of early childhood, and nearly all epidemiologic studies show a higher susceptibility to KD in males. Large database studies suggest that the hospitalization rate for KD in the United States has been mostly stable over time, although the proportion of hospitalizations complicated by "KD shock syndrome" has increased over time. In 2017, the Kids' Inpatient Database esti- mated 19.3 hospitalizations/100,000 children <4 years of age. Children of Asian/Pacific Islander descent had the highest rates of KD among all racial groups. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Japan, the rate of KD seems to be increasing. In Japan, nationwide sur- veys have been administered every 2 years to monitor trends in KD incidence. In 2018 the highest recorded rate thus far of 359 per 100,000 children ages 0-4 years was described, with the highest rate in young children ages 9-11 months. Fortunately, the proportion of Japanese

(Modified from Kato H. Cardiovascular complications in Kawasaki disease: coronary artery lumen and long-term consequences. Prog Pediatr Cardiol. 2004;19:137-145.) patients with coronary aneurysms and myocardial infarction has decreased over time, at 2.6% for the former in the most recent survey. Several risk-stratification models have been constructed to deter- mine which patients with KD are at highest risk for CAA. Predictors of poor outcome across several studies include young age; being male; persistent prolonged fever; poor response to IVIG; and laboratory abnormalities, including neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, transami- nitis, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated levels of N-terminal brain natriuretic protein, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Asian, Pacific Islander, and Hispanic ethnicity are also risk factors for CAA. Three risk scores for IVIG resistance, which refers to incom- plete response to the first treatment, have been constructed by Japa- nese researchers; of these, the Kobayashi score is the most widely used and has high sensitivity and specificity. Unfortunately, when applied to non-Japanese populations, these scores do not appear to be as accurate in identifying children at risk for IVIG resistance and CAA. Body sur- face area (BSA)-adjusted coronary artery dimensions on initial echo- cardiography are good predictors of CAA development. In a North American cohort, coronary artery z scores ≥2.0 are predictive of CAA development; similar findings have been reported in Japanese cohorts as well. Accordingly, coronary artery z scores at initial presentation are useful imaging biomarkers that can be used to guide adjunctive therapy for high-risk patients. PATHOLOGY KD is a vasculitis that predominantly affects medium-size arteries. The coronary arteries are most often involved, although other arter- ies (e.g., axillary, subclavian, femoral, popliteal, brachial) can also develop dilation. A three-phase process to the arteriopathy of KD has been described. The first phase is a neutrophilic necrotizing arteritis occurring in the first 2 weeks of illness that begins in the endothelium and moves through the coronary wall. Saccular aneurysms may form from this arteritis. The second phase is a subacute/chronic vasculitis driven by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils, which may last weeks to years and results in fusiform aneurysms. The vessels affected by the subacute/chronic vasculitis then develop smooth muscle cell myofibroblasts, which may cause diminution of internal lumen dimen- sion and progressive stenosis in the third phase. Thrombi may form in the lumen and obstruct blood flow (Fig. 208.1). CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Fever is characteristically high (≥38.3°C [101°F]), persistent, and unre- sponsive to antipyretics. The duration of fever without treatment is generally 1-2 weeks but may be as short as 5 days or may persist for 3-4 weeks. In addition to fever, the five principal clinical criteria of KD are (1) bilateral nonexudative conjunctival injection with limbal spar- ing; (2) erythema of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa with strawberry tongue and red, cracked lips; (3) edema (induration) and erythema of the hands and feet; (4) rash of various forms (maculopapular, urticarial, erythema multiforme-like, scarlatiniform, and rarely, micropustular or psoriatic-like); and (5) nonsuppurative cervical lymphadenopathy, usually unilateral, with node size > 1.5 cm (Table 208.1 and Figs. 208.2- 208.5). Supercial perineal desquamation is common in the acute phase. Periungual desquamation of the fingers and toes begins 2-3 weeks after the onset of illness and may progress to involve the entire hand and foot (Fig. 208.6). Additional symptoms other than the principal clinical criteria are common in the 10 days before diagnosis of KD, which may be explained in part by the finding that up to a third of patients with KD have confirmed, concurrent infections.

Philadelphia: Saunders; 1993.) symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain) occur in >60% of patients, and at least one respiratory symptom (rhinorrhea or cough) occurs in 35%. Other clinical findings can include significant irritabil- ity that is especially prominent in infants and likely caused by aseptic meningitis, mild hepatitis, hydrops of the gallbladder, urethritis and meatitis with sterile pyuria, uveitis, and arthritis. Arthritis may occur early in the illness or may develop in the second or third week. Small or Chapter 208 • Kawasaki Disease 1543 large joints may be affected, and the arthralgias may persist for several weeks. Patients previously vaccinated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) may show reactivation at the inoculation site. Clinical features that are not consistent with KD include exudative/purulent conjunc- tivitis; exudative pharyngitis; generalized lymphadenopathy; discrete oral lesions (e.g., ulceration); splenomegaly; and bullous, petechial, or vesicular rashes. Cardiac involvement is the most important manifestation of KD. Myocarditis may occur in patients with acute KD and may manifest as tachycardia disproportionate to fever, along with diminished left ventricular systolic function. Occasionally, patients with KD present in cardiogenic shock (KD shock syndrome), with hypotension and greatly diminished left ventricular function. In addition, KD shock syndrome may manifest with thrombocytopenia, a high band count, and a high CRP. Case series of KD shock syndrome indicate that these patients may be at higher risk for coronary artery dilation. Pericarditis with a small pericardial effusion can also occur during the acute ill- ness. Mitral regurgitation of at least mild severity is evident on echo- cardiography in 10-25% of patients at presentation but diminishes over time, except among rare patients with coronary aneurysms and ischemic heart disease. Up to 25% of untreated patients develop CAA by Japanese Ministry of Health criteria in the second to third week of illness; initially these are usually asymptomatic and detected by echo- cardiography. Almost all the morbidity and mortality in KD occur in patients with large or giant coronary artery aneurysms, defined by the 2017 American Heart Association (AHA) scientific statement on the diagnosis and treatment of KD as having a z score ≥10 or an abso- lute dimension of ≥8 mm. Specifically, large or giant aneurysms are associated with the greatest risk of later thrombosis or stenosis, angina, and myocardial infarction (Figs. 208.7 and 208.8A). Rupture of a giant aneurysm is a rare complication that generally occurs in the first month after illness onset and may present as hemopericardium with tampon- ade. Axillary, popliteal, iliac, or other systemic medium-sized muscular arteries may also become aneurysmal, but always in the setting of giant coronary aneurysms (see Fig. 208.8B); these usually regress. Occasionally KD presents initially with only fever and lymphade- nopathy (node-first KD). This presentation may be confused with bac- terial or viral cervical lymphadenitis and may delay the diagnosis and treatment. Persistence of high fever, lack of response to antibiotics, and subsequent development of other signs of KD suggest the diagnosis. Children with node-first KD tend to be older (4 vs 2 years) and have more days of fever and higher CRP levels. In addition to cervical ade- nopathy, many node-first patients had retropharyngeal and peritonsil- lar inflammation on CT scans (Fig. 208.9). Patients with node-first KD have a higher incidence of coronary aneurysms. Patients with infec- tious adenitis usually respond to antibiotics; they may have abscesses noted on imaging studies (ultrasonography or CT). KD can be divided into three clinical phases. The acute febrile phase is characterized by fever and the other acute signs of illness and usually lasts 1-2 weeks. The subacute phase is associated with desquamation, thrombocytosis, development of CAA, and the highest risk of sudden death in patients who develop aneurysms; it generally lasts 3 weeks. The convalescent phase begins when all clinical signs of illness have disappeared and continues until the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) returns to normal, typically 6-8 weeks after the onset of illness. LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGY FINDINGS There is no diagnostic test for KD, but patients usually have character- istic laboratory findings. The leukocyte count is often elevated, with a predominance of neutrophils and immature forms. Normocytic, nor- mochromic anemia is common. The platelet count is generally normal in the first week of illness and rapidly increases by the second to third week of illness, sometimes exceeding 1 million/mm'. An elevated ESR or CRP value is universally present in the acute phase of illness. The ESR may remain elevated for weeks, in part from the effect of IVIG. Sterile pyuria, mild elevations of the hepatic transaminases, hyperbili- rubinemia, and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis may also be present. KD is unlikely if the ESR, CRP, and platelet counts are normal after 7 days of fever.

Left, Giant aneurysm of the left anterior descending coronary ar- tery (LAD) with obstruction. Right, Giant aneurysm of the right coronary artery (RCA) with an area of severe narrowing. (From Newburger JW, Takahashi M, Gerber MA, et al. Diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of Kawasaki disease. Pediatrics. 2004;114:1708-1733.) Two-dimensional echocardiography is the most useful test to monitor for development of CAA. Although frank aneurysms are rarely detected in the first week of illness, coronary arteries are commonly dilated. Coro- nary artery dimensions, adjusted for BSA (2 scores), may increase over the first 6 weeks of illness, and higher z scores at the time of diagnosis are the strongest risk factor for the presence of coronary aneurysms 2-8 weeks after illness onset. Children with non-KD febrile illnesses also have mildly increased z scores compared with nonfebrile controls, but to a lesser degree than patients with KD. Aneurysms have been defined with the use of absolute dimensions by the Japanese Ministry of Health and are classified as small (≤4 mm internal diameter [ID]), medium (>4 to ≤8 mm ID), or giant (>8 mm ID). Some experts believe that a z score- based system for classification of aneurysm size may be more discrimi- nating, because it adjusts the coronary dimension for BSA. The AHA z score classification system is noted in Table 208.2. Echocardiography should be performed at diagnosis and again after 1-2 weeks of illness. If the results are normal, a repeat study should be performed 6-8 weeks after onset of illness. If results of either of the initial studies are abnormal or the patient has recurrent fever or symp- toms, more frequent echocardiography or other studies may be neces- sary. In patients in whom CAA has not developed in the first 4-6 weeks of illness, the patient may be discharged from cardiology care, although follow-up through 12 months may be considered. Children and fami- lies should be counseled regarding healthy diet and the importance of exercise at regular primary care visits. For patients with CAA, the type of testing and the frequency of cardiology follow-up visits are tailored to the patient's coronary artery status (see Table 208.2).

Computed tomographic findings of Kawasaki disease with cervical lymphadenopathy. J Comput Assist Tomogr. 2012;36(1):138-142, Fig. 1, p. 139.) DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of KD is based on the presence of characteristic clinical signs. For classic KD, the diagnostic criteria require the presence of fever for at least 5 days and at least four of five of the other princi- pal characteristics of the illness (see Table 208.1). The diagnosis of KD should be made within 10 days, and ideally within 7 days, of fever onset to improve coronary artery outcomes. In incomplete KD, patients have persistent fever but fewer than four of the five characteristic clini- cal signs. In patients with incomplete KD, laboratory and echocardio- graphic data can assist in the diagnosis (Fig. 208.10). Incomplete cases occur most frequently in infants, who also have the highest likelihood of development of CAA. Ambiguous cases should be referred to a cen- ter with experience in the diagnosis of KD. Establishing the diagnosis with prompt initiation of treatment is essential to prevent potentially devastating coronary artery disease. For this reason, it is recommended that any infant age ≤6 months with fever for ≥7 days and signs of systemic inflammation without explanation undergo echocardiography to assess the coronary arteries. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Adenovirus, measles, and scarlet fever lead the list of common child- hood infections that mimic KD (Table 208.3). Children with adenovi- rus typically have exudative pharyngitis and exudative conjunctivitis, allowing differentiation from KD. A common clinical problem is the differentiation of scarlet fever from KD in a child who is a group A streptococcal carrier. Patients with scarlet fever typically have a rapid clinical response to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Such treatment for 24-48 hours with clinical reassessment generally clarifies the diagnosis. Furthermore, ocular findings are quite rare in group A streptococcal pharyngitis and may assist in the diagnosis of KD. Features of measles that distinguish it from KD include exudative conjunctivitis, Koplik spots, rash that begins on the face and hairline and behind the ears, and leukopenia. Cervical lymphadenitis can be the initial diagnosis in children who are ultimately recognized to have KD. Less com- mon infections such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and leptospirosis are occasionally confused with KD. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a poten- tially lethal bacterial infection, and appropriate antibiotics should not be withheld if the diagnosis is under consideration. Its distinguishing features include pronounced myalgias and headache at onset, centripetal rash, and petechiae on the palms and soles. Leptospirosis can also be an illness of considerable severity.

The classic description of leptospirosis is of a biphasic illness with a few asymptomatic days between an initial period of fever and headache and a late phase with renal and hepatic fail- ure. In contrast, patients with KD have consecutive days of fever at diagno- sis and rarely have renal or hepatic failure. Drug hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syn- drome, share some characteristics with KD. Drug reaction features such as the presence of oral ulcerations and a normal or minimally elevated ESR are not seen in KD. Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is also characterized by fever and rash, but physical findings include dif- fuse lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Arthritis may or may not be present in the initial illness. Fevers typically show a quotidian or double-quotidian pattern, in contrast to the unremitting fevers seen in KD. Laboratory findings may include coagulopathy, elevated fibrin deg- radation product values, and hyperterritinemia. Interestingly, there are reports of children with sIA who have echocardiographic evidence of CAA. Coronary aneurysms have also been reported in Behçet disease, primary cytomegalovirus infection, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, lupus, infantile polyarteritis nodosa, hyper-IgE syndrome, hyper-IgD syndrome (mevalonic aciduria), and meningococcemia. Children with KD may present with Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, with a clinical picture similar to that of toxic shock syn- drome or of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C; see Chapter 311). Features of toxic shock syndrome that are not usually seen in KD include renal insufficiency, coagulopathy, pancytopenia, and myositis. With COVID-19 disease, some children developed a KD-like ill- nesses presenting in cardiogenic shock. multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), also known as pediatric inflamma- tory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS), occurs 2-6 weeks after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The initial infection may be asymptomatic. Children with MIS-C may show conjunctival injection, oropharyngeal changes, and rashes similar to that seen in KD. CAAs have also been described in MIS- C, but the risk of CAA in MIS-C does not strictly correlate with criteria for incomplete or complete KD. Furthermore, patients are often older and have a greater degree of myocardial dysfunction as compared with KD; distinguishing laboratory features include greater hyperferritinemia, more pronounced cytopenias, and ele- vated D-dimer in MIS-C (Table 208.4).

Characteristics suggesting that another diagnosis should be considered include exudative conjunctivitis, exudative pharyngitis, ulcerative intraoral lesions, bullous or vesicular rash, generalized adenopathy, and splenomegaly. 3Infants so months of age are most likely to develop prolonged fever without other clinical criteria for KD; these infants are at particularly high risk of developing coronary artery abnormalities. Echocardiography is considered positive for purposes of this algorithm if any of three conditions are met: z score of left anterior descending coronary artery or right coronary artery ≥2.5; coronary artery aneurysm is observed; or three or more other suggestive features exist, including decreased left ventricular function, mitral regurgitation, pericardial effusion, or z scores in the left anterior descending coronary artery or right coronary artery of 2-2.5. *If the echocardiogram is positive, treatment should be given within 10 days of fever onset or after the 10th day of fever in the presence of clinical and laboratory signs (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) of ongoing inflammation.

TREATMENT Patients with acute KD should be treated with 2 g/kg of IVIG as a single infusion, usually administered over 10-12 hours within 10 days of dis- ease onset, and ideally as soon as possible after diagnosis (Table 208.5). 

In addition, moderate-dose (30-50 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours) aspirin should be administered until the patient is afebrile, then low- ered to antiplatelet doses (3-5 mg/kg/day). Other NSAIDs should not be given during therapy with aspirin because they may block aspirin's antiplatelet effect. The mechanism of action of IVIG in KD is likely multifaceted, but treatment results in defervescence and resolution of clinical signs of illness in approximately 85% of patients. Using Japa- nese Ministry of Health criteria, the prevalence of coronary disease is 20-25% in children treated with aspirin alone and falls to < 5% in those treated with IVIG and aspirin within the first 10 days of illness. In chil- dren diagnosed after the 10th day of fever, IVIG should still be offered to patients with persistent fever, abnormal dimensions of the coronary arteries, or signs of systemic inflammation. Low-dose aspirin is contin- ued for its antithrombotic effect until 6-8 weeks after illness onset and is then discontinued in patients who have had normal echocardiogra- phy findings throughout the course of their illness. Patients with CAA continue with aspirin therapy longer and may require anticoagulation, depending on the degree of coronary dilation (see later). Glucocorticoids have been used as primary therapy with the first dose of IVIG in hopes of improving coronary outcomes. A North American trial using a single pulse dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/ kg) with IVIG as primary therapy did not improve coronary outcomes. However, a trial in Japan using the Kobayashi score to identify high-risk children demonstrated improved coronary outcomes with a regimen of Table 208.5 Treatment of Kawasaki Disease ACUTE STAGE Standard risk: Intravenous immune globulin 2g/kg over 10-12 hr and Aspirin 30-50 mg/kg/day divided every 6hr orally until patient is afebrile for at least 48 hr High risk* for coronary artery abnormalities: Intravenous immune globulin and aspirin as above, plus methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/d IV divided q12hr until afebrile, then prednisolone orally until CRP normalized, then taper over 2-3 wk CONVALESCENT STAGE Aspirin 3-5 mg/kg once daily orally until 6- after illness onset if normal coronary findings throughout course *High risk for coronary artery abnormalities is defined as age <6 months or baseline left anterior descending (LAD) or right circumflex artery (RCA) z-score greater than or equal to 2.5. Chapter 208 • Kawasaki Disease 1547 methylprednisolone/prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day, divided every 12 hours) plus IVIG as primary therapy. Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 comparative studies demonstrated that early treat- ment with glucocorticoids improved coronary artery outcomes in chil- dren with KD. These data suggest that primary glucocorticoid therapy in addition to standard of care (IVIG plus aspirin) may be helpful in chil- dren at high risk for CAA. Fewer data are available to support the use of TNF alpha inhibitors for prevention of coronary artery aneurysms. IVIG-resistant KD (nonresponders) occurs in approximately 15% of patients and is defined by persistent or recrudescent fever 36 hours after completion of the initial IVIG infusion. Patients with IVIG resis- tance are at increased risk for CAA. Therapeutic options for the child with IVIG resistance include a second dose of IVIG (2 g/kg), a taper- ing course of glucocorticoids, infliximab, or possibly anakinra (Table 208.6). For the most severely affected patients with enlarging coronary aneurysms, additional therapies such as cyclosporine or cyclophospha- mide may be administered, with consultation from specialists in pedi- atric rheumatology and cardiology. COMPLICATIONS Acute KD is complicated in 1-2% of patients by macrophage activa- tion syndrome (MAS; see Chapter 207), a syndrome of life-threatening hyperinflammation on the spectrum of hemophagocytic lymphohis- tiocytosis. MAS may mimic MIS-C. These patients may present with hyperferritinemia, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and shock, war- ranting more aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. In all phases of KD, patients with giant coronary aneurysms may experience myocardial infarction, angina, and sudden death due to thrombosis. For this reason, aspirin is continued indefinitely in chil- dren with coronary aneurysms (Table 208.7). When aneurysms are moderate-sized, dual antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin and clopidogrel) is sometimes administered. For those with large or giant aneurysms, anti- coagulation with warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin is added to aspirin. For acute thrombosis that occasionally occurs in an aneurysmal or stenotic coronary artery, thrombolytic therapy may be lifesaving. In very rare circumstances of severe, giant aneurysms, rupture can occur. Long-term follow-up of patients with CAAs is tailored to the past (i.e., worst-ever) and current coronary status, with a schedule of testing recom- mended in the 2017 AHA scientific statement on KD (see Table 208.2). Testing may include echocardiography, assessment for inducible ischemia, advanced imaging (CT, MRI, or invasive angiography), physical activ- ity counseling, and cardiovascular risk factor assessment and manage- ment. Patients with coronary artery stenosis and inducible ischemia may be managed with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or catheter Table 208.6 Treatment Options for IVIG-Resistant Patients with Kawasaki Disease* AGENT DESCRIPTION MOST FREQUENTLY ADMINISTERED VIG: second infusion Pooled polyclonal IG IVIG + methylprednisolone/ IVIG + glucocorticoid prednisolone Infliximab Monoclonal antibody against TNF-a ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS Anakinra DOSE 2 g/kg IV IVG: 2g/kg IV + methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/d IV divided every 12 hr until afebrile, then oral prednisolone 2 mg/kg/d divided twice daily Single infusion: 5-10 mg/kg IV Cyclosporine Recombinant IL-1p receptor antagonist Inhibitor of calcineurin-NFAT pathway 2-8 mg/kg/day given by subcutaneous injection or IV infusion IV: 3 mg/kg/d divided every 12hr PO: 4-8 mg/kg/d divided every 12 hr Adjust dose to achieve trough 50-150 ng/mL; 2 hr peak level 300-600 ng/mL Cyclophosphamide Alkylating agent blocks DNA replication 10-15 mg/kg IV, 1 or 2 doses Plasma exchange Replaces plasma with albumin 1-5 cycles *IVIG resistance is defined as persistent or recrudescent fever at least 36 hr and <7 days after completion of first IVIG infusion.

Wu interventions, including percutaneous transluminal coronary rotational ablation, directional coronary atherectomy, and stent implantation. Patients undergoing long-term aspirin therapy should receive annual influenza vaccination to reduce the risk of Reye syndrome. A different antiplatelet agent can be substituted for aspirin during the 6 weeks after varicella vaccination. IVIG may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines as a result of a specific antiviral antibody, so the measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccinations should generally be deferred until 11 months after IVIG administration. Nonlive vaccina- tions do not need to be delayed. PROGNOSIS The vast majority of patients with KD return to normal health; timely treatment reduces the risk of coronary aneurysms to <5%. Acute KD recurs in 1-3% of cases. Published fatality rates are very low, generally <1%. The prognosis for patients with CAA depends on the severity of coronary disease; therefore recommendations for follow-up and management are stratified according to coro- nary artery status. A 6-week echocardiogram may be unnecessary in patients with normal coronary artery measurements at baseline and at 2 weeks of illness, as these children very rarely develop new abnormalities over time. Overall, ~50% of CAAs remodel to normal lumen diameter by 1-2 years after the illness, with smaller aneu- rysms being more likely to regress. Intravascular ultrasonography has demonstrated that regressed aneurysms are associated with marked myointimal thickening and abnormal vascular function. Giant aneurysms are less likely to regress to normal lumen diameter and are more likely to lead to thrombosis or stenosis. Bypass graft- ing may be required if there is inducible ischemia; it is best accom- plished with the use of arterial grafts, which grow with the child and are more likely than venous grafts to remain patent over the long term. Heart transplantation has been required in rare cases where revascularization is not feasible because of distal coronary stenoses, distal aneurysms, or severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. A study from Japan reported outcomes in adult patients with a history of KD and giant aneurysms. These patients required multiple cardiac and sur- gical procedures, but the 30-years survival rate approached 90%. The long-term outcomes of children who have had KD and never had coronary artery abnormalities, based upon reliable echocardio- grams performed early in the course of disease, appear to be similar to those in the normative population. Although studies of endothelial dysfunction in children with a history of KD and normal coronary dimensions have produced conflicting results, reassuring data suggest that the standardized mortality ratio among adults in Japan who had KD in childhood without aneurysms is indistinguishable from that of the general population. All children with a history of KD should be counseled regarding a heart-healthy diet, adequate amounts of exer- cise, tobacco avoidance, and intermittent lipid monitoring. Among children with coronary aneurysms, the AHA recommends treatment thresholds for risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease that are lower than those for the normal population.

There appears to be two distinct, age-dependent patterns of disease among children with sarcoidosis. The clinical features in older children are similar to those in adults (pediatric-onset adult sarcoid- osis), with frequent systemic features (fever, weight loss, malaise), pul- monary involvement, and lymphadenopathy. In contrast, early-onset sarcoidosis manifesting in children <4 years of age is characterized by the triad of rash, uveitis, and polyarthritis. ETIOLOGY The etiology of sarcoidosis remains obscure but likely results from exposure of a genetically susceptible individual to one or more uniden- tified antigens. This exposure initiates an exaggerated immunologic response that ultimately leads to the formation of granulomas. The human major histocompatibility complex is located on chromosome 6, and specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II alleles are associated with disease phenotype. Genetic polymorphisms involving various cytokines and chemokines may also have a role in development of sarcoidosis. Familial clustering supports the contri- bution of genetic factors to sarcoidosis susceptibility. Environmental and occupational exposures are also associated with disease risk. There are positive associations between sarcoidosis and agricultural employ- ment, occupational exposure to insecticides, and moldy environments typically associated with microbial bioaerosols. Blau syndrome is an autosomal dominant, familial form of sarcoid- osis and is typified by the early onset of granulomatous inflammation involving the skin, eyes, and joints. Pathogenic genetic variants in the CARD15/NOD2 gene have been found in affected family members and appear to be associated with development of sarcoidosis. Similar genetic variants have been found in individuals with a sporadic early- onset sarcoidosis (EOS) (rash, uveitis, arthritis), suggesting that this nonfamilial form and Blau syndrome are genetically and phenotypi- cally identical (see Chapter 204). EPIDEMIOLOGY A nationwide patient registry of childhood sarcoidosis in Denmark estimated the annual incidence to be 0.22-0.27 per 100,000 children. The incidence increases with age, and peak onset occurs at 20-39 years. The most common age of reported childhood cases is 13-15 years. In comparison, an international registry and Spanish cohort of Blau syn- drome and EOS reported the mean age of disease onset as 30 months and 36 months, respectively. There is no clear gender predilection in any form of childhood sarcoidosis. The majority of U.S. childhood sar- coidosis cases are reported in the southeastern and southcentral states. PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS Noncaseating, epithelioid granulomatous lesions are a cardinal feature of sarcoidosis. Activated macrophages, epithelioid cells, and multi- nucleated giant cells, as well as CD4+ T lymphocytes, accumulate and become tightly packed in the center of the granuloma. The causative agent that initiates this inflammatory process is unknown. The periph- ery of the granuloma contains a loose collection of monocytes, CD4* and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and fibroblasts. The interaction between the macrophages and CD4+ T lymphocytes is important in the formation and maintenance of the granuloma. The activated macrophages secrete high levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and other proinflamma- tory mediators. The CD4+ T lymphocytes differentiate into type 1 helper T cells and release interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-y, promot- ing proliferation of lymphocytes. Granulomas may heal or resolve with complete preservation of the parenchyma. In approximately 20% of the 

lesions, the fibroblasts in the periphery proliferate and produce fibrotic scar tissue, leading to significant and irreversible organ dysfunction. The sarcoid macrophage is able to produce and secrete 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D, or calcitriol, an active form of vitamin D typi- cally produced in the kidneys. The hormones natural functions are to increase intestinal absorption of calcium and bone resorption and decrease renal excretion of calcium and phosphate. An excess of cal- citriol may result in hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in patients with sarcoidosis. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease, and granulomatous lesions may occur in any organ of the body. The clinical manifestations depend on the extent and degree of granulomatous inflammation and are extremely variable. Children may present with nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and general malaise. In adults and older chil- dren, pulmonary involvement is most frequent, with infiltration of the thoracic lymph nodes and lung parenchyma. Isolated bilateral hilar adenopathy on chest radiograph is the most common finding (Fig. 209.1), but parenchymal infiltrates and miliary nodules may also be seen (Figs. 209.2, 209.3, and 209.4). Patients with lung involvement are usually found to have restrictive changes on pulmonary function test- ing. Symptoms of pulmonary disease are seldom severe and generally consist of a dry, persistent cough. Extrathoracic lymphadenopathy and infiltration of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow also occur often (Table 209.1). Infiltration of the liver and spleen typically leads to isolated hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, respectively, but actual organ dysfunction is rare. Cutaneous disease, such as plaques, nodules, erythema nodosum in acute disease, or lupus pernio in chronic sarcoidosis, appears in one quarter of cases and is usu- ally present at onset. Red-brown to purple maculopapular lesions <1 cm on the face, neck, upper back, and extremities are the most com- mon skin finding (Fig. 209.5). Papulonodular granulomatous lesions have been reported to develop in cosmetic eyebrows) and decorative tattoos (tattoo sarcoidosis). Ocular involvement is frequent and has variable manifestations, including anterior or posterior uveitis, conjunc- tival granulomas, eyelid inflammation, and orbital or lacrimal gland infiltration. The arthritis in sarcoidosis can be confused with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is rare in early childhood but may manifest as seizures, cranial nerve involvement, intracranial mass lesions, and hypothalamic dysfunction (Fig. 209.6). Kidney disease occurs infrequently in children but typically Fig. 209.1 Sarcoidosis. Chest radiograph demonstrating stage I dis- ease with enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.

Only a small fraction of children have hyper- calcemia or hypercalciuria. Sarcoid granulomas can also infiltrate the heart and lead to cardiac arrhythmias and, rarely, sudden death. Other

S4.) rare sites of disease involvement include blood vessels of any size, the gastrointestinal tract, parotid gland, muscles, bones, and testes. In contrast to the variable clinical presentation of sarcoidosis in older children, Blau syndrome and EOS (NOD2-associated sarcoid- osis) classically manifest as the triad of uveitis, arthritis, and rash (see Chapter 204). Infantile-onset panniculitis with uveitis and sys- temic granulomatosis is an uncommon manifestation of sarcoidosis. LABORATORY FINDINGS There is no single standard laboratory test diagnostic of sarcoidosis. Anemia, leukopenia, and eosinophilia may be seen. Other nonspecific findings include hypergammaglobulinemia and elevations in acute- phase reactants, including ESR and CRP. Hypercalcemia and/or hyper- calciuria occur in only a small proportion of children with sarcoidosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is produced by the epithelioid cells of the granuloma, and its serum value may be elevated, but this finding lacks diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. ACE levels are esti- mated to be elevated in >50% of children with sarcoidosis. In addition, ACE values may be difficult to interpret because reference values for serum ACE are age dependent. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emis- sion tomography (FDG-PET) (with either CT or MRI) can help iden- tity nonpulmonary (lymph nodes, bone, cardiac, liver, spleen) sites for a diagnostic evaluation or biopsy (Fig. 209.7). DIAGNOSIS Definitive diagnosis ultimately requires demonstration of the charac- teristic noncaseating granulomatous lesions in a biopsy specimen (usu- ally taken from the most readily available affected organ) and exclusion of other known causes of granulomatous inflammation. Skin and trans- bronchial lung biopsies have higher yield, greater specificity, and fewer associated adverse events than biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes or liver. Additional diagnostic testing includes chest radiography, pulmo- nary function testing with measurement of diffusion capacity, hepatic enzyme measurements, and renal function assessment. Ophthalmo- logic slit-lamp examination is essential because ocular inflammation is frequently present and may be asymptomatic in sarcoidosis, and vision loss is a sequela of untreated disease. Bronchoalveolar lavage may be used to assess for disease activity, and the fluid typically reveals an excess of lymphocytes with an increased CD4*/CD8* ratio of 2-13:1. In addition to flexible bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy, endosonographic-guided intrathoracic node aspiration has been valuable in obtaining tissue to assess for noncaseat- ing granulomas.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Because of its protean manifestations, the differential diagnosis of sarcoid- osis is extremely broad and depends largely on the initial clinical manifesta- tions. Granulomatous infections, including tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, pulmonary mycoses (histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis), brucellosis, tularemia, and toxoplasmosis, must be excluded. Other causes of granulomatous inflammation are granulomatosis with polyangiitis (for- merly Wegener granulomatosis), hypersensitivity pneumonia, chronic berylliosis, and other occupational exposures to metals. Localized granu- lomatous lesions of the head and neck may be due to orofacial granu- lomatosis (Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome).

Immunodeficiencies that may manifest with granulomatous lesions include common variable immunodeficiency, selective IgA deficiency, chronic granulomatous disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and severe combined immunodeficiency. Granulomas of the lung, skin, or lymph nodes have been reported in patients treated with anti-TNF agents. Lymphoma should be ruled out in cases of hilar or other lymphadenopathy. Sarcoid arthritis may mimic JIA. Evaluation for endocrine disorders is needed in the setting of hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. TREATMENT Treatment should be based on disease severity and the number and type of organs involved. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for most acute and chronic disease manifestations. The optimal dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy in children have not been estab- lished. Induction treatment typically begins with oral prednisone or prednisolone (1-2 mg/kg/day up to 40 mg daily) for 8-12 weeks until manifestations improve. Corticosteroid dosage is then gradually decreased over 6-12 months to the minimal effective maintenance dose (e.g., 5-10 mg/day) that controls symptoms, or discontinued if symptoms resolve. Methotrexate or leflunomide may be effective as a corticosteroid-sparing agent. On the basis of the role of TNF-a in the formation of granulomas, there is rationale for the use of TNF-a antag- onists. Results of small clinical trials showed modest effects with inf- liximab and adalimumab treatment of selected disease manifestations (CNS, lupus pernio, pulmonary, ocular), whereas etanercept does not appear to be particularly effective. Other therapeutics used for sarcoid- osis manifestations include topical corticosteroids (eye), inhaled cor- ticosteroids (lung), azathioprine (CNS), cyclophosphamide (cardiac, CNS), hydroxychloroquine (skin), mycophenolate mofetil (CNS, skin), thalidomide or its analogs (skin), and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (joints). PROGNOSIS The prognosis of childhood sarcoidosis is not well defined. The dis- ease may be self-limited with complete recovery or may persist with a progressive or relapsing course. Outcome is worse in the setting of 

1552 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) multiorgan or CNS involvement. Most children requiring treatment experience considerable improvement with corticosteroids, although a significant number have morbid sequelae, mainly involving the lungs and eyes. Children with early-onset sarcoidosis have a poorer progno- sis and generally experience a more chronic, progressive disease course. The greatest morbidity is associated with ocular involvement, includ- ing cataract formation, development of synechiae, and loss of visual acuity or blindness. Long-term systemic treatment may be required for the eye disease. Progressive polyarthritis may result in joint destruc- tion. The overall mortality rate in older children with sarcoidosis is low. Serial pulmonary function tests and chest radiographs are useful in following the course of lung involvement. Monitoring for other organ involvement should also include electrocardiogram with consideration of an echocardiogram, urinalysis, renal function tests, and measure- ments of hepatic enzymes and serum calcium. Other potential indi- cators of disease activity include inflammatory markers and serum ACE, although changes in ACE level do not always correlate with other indicators of disease status. Given the frequency of asymptomatic eye disease and the ocular morbidity associated with pediatric sarcoidosis, all patients should have an ophthalmologic examination at presenta- tion with monitoring at regular intervals, perhaps every 3-6 months, as recommended in children with JIA.

Large vessel vasculitis affects large arteries more often than other vasculitides. Medium vessel vasculitis predominantly affects medium arteries. Small vessel vasculitis predominantly affects small vessels, but medium arteries and veins may be affected, although im- mune complex small vessel vasculitis rarely affects arteries.

(From Jennette JC, Falk RJ, Bacon PA, et al. 2012 Revised International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference Nomenclature of Vasculitides. Arthritis Rheum. 2013;65:1-11, Fig. 2, p. 4.) Childhood vasculitis encompasses a broad spectrum of diseases that share inflammation of the blood vessels as the central pathophysiology. The pathogenesis of the vasculitides is generally idiopathic. Some forms of vasculitis are associated with infectious agents and medications, whereas others may occur in the setting of preexisting autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases. The pattern of vessel injury provides insight into the form of vasculitis and serves as a framework to delineate the different vasculitic syndromes. The distribution of vascular injury includes small vessels (capillaries, arterioles, and postcapillary venules), medium vessels (renal arteries, mesenteric vasculature, and coronary arteries), and large vessels (the aorta and its proximal branches) (Fig. 210.1). Additionally, some forms of small vessel vasculitis are char- acterized by the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), whereas others are associated with immune complex depo- sition in affected tissues. A combination of clinical features, histologic appearance of involved vessels, and laboratory data is used to classify vasculitis (Tables 210.1-210.4). A nomenclature system from the 2012 International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (see Table 210.1) has proposed using the pathologic diagnosis rather than eponyms for vas- culitis nomenclature. For example, Henoch-Schönlein purpura would be referred to as IgA vasculitis. Additionally, the classification crite- ria endorsed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), Pediatric Rheumatology International Trial Organization (PRINTO), and Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES) have been vali- dated in childhood vasculitis (see Table 210.2). Childhood vasculitis varies from a relatively benign and self-limited disease such as Henoch-Schönlein purpura (IgA vasculitis) to cata- strophic disease with end-organ damage, as seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener granulomatosis). Vasculitis generally manifests as a heterogeneous multisystem disease. Although some tea- tures, such as purpura, are easily identihable, others, such as hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis or glomerulonephritis, can be subtler. Ultimately, the key to recognizing vasculitis relies heavily on pattern rec- ognition. Demonstration of vessel injury and inflammation on biopsy or vascular imaging is required to confirm a diagnosis of vasculitis. Clues to the diagnosis of a vasculitis disorder are noted in Table 210.3, and a broad diagnostic approach is noted in Table 210.5.

Ardoin Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis of childhood and is characterized by leukocytoclastic vasculitis and immunoglobulin A deposition in the small vessels in the skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney. HSP is also referred to as IgA vas- culitis, based on the presence of vasculitis with predominance of IgA deposits affecting small vessels.

Textbook of Pediatric Rheumatology, 7th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders; 2016. EPIDEMIOLOGY HSP occurs worldwide and affects all ethnic groups. The incidence is estimated at 14-20 per 100,000 children per year and affects males more than females, with a 1.2-1.8:1 male/female ratio. Approximately 90% of HSP cases occur in children, usually between ages 3 and 10 years. HSP is distinctly less common in adults, who often have severe and chronic complications. HSP is more common in the winter and spring and is unusual in summer months. Many cases of HSP follow a documented upper respiratory infection. PATHOLOGY Skin biopsies demonstrate leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the der- mal capillaries and postcapillary venules. The inflammatory infiltrate includes neutrophils and monocytes. Renal histopathology typically shows endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis, ranging from a focal segmental process to extensive crescentic involvement. In all tis- sues, immunofluorescence identifies IgA deposition in walls of small vessels (Fig. 210.2), accompanied to a lesser extent by deposition of C3, fibrin, and IgM. PATHOGENESIS The exact pathogenesis of HSP remains unknown. Given the seasonal- ity of HSP and the frequency of preceding upper respiratory infections, infectious triggers such as group A S-hemolytic streptococcus, Staphy- lococcus aureus, Mycoplasma, and adenovirus have been suspected. The common finding of deposition of IgA, specifically IgA,, suggests that HSP is a disease mediated by lgA and IgA immune complexes. HSP occasionally clusters in families, suggesting a genetic component. HLA-B34 and HLA-DRB1*01 alleles have been linked to HSP nephri- tis. Patients with familial Mediterranean fever, hereditary periodic fever syndromes, and complement deficiencies are at increased risk for developing HSP, suggesting that genetically determined immune dys- regulation may contribute. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS The hallmark of HSP is its rash: palpable purpura starting as pink mac- ules or wheals and developing into petechiae, raised purpura, or larger ecchymoses. Occasionally, bullae and ulcerations develop. The skin lesions are usually symmetric and occur in gravity-dependent areas (lower extremities), the extensor aspect of the upper extremities, or on pressure points (buttocks) (Figs. 210.2 and 210.3). The skin lesions often evolve in groups, typically lasting 3-10 days, and may recur up to 4 months after initial presentation. Subcutaneous edema localized to the dorsa of the hands and feet, periorbital area, lips, scrotum, or scalp is also common. Musculoskeletal involvement, including arthritis and arthralgias, is common, occurring in up to 75% of children with HSP. The arthritis tends to be self-limited and oligoarticular, with a predilection for large joints such as the knees and ankles, and does not lead to deformities. Periarticular swelling and tenderness without erythema or effusions are common. The arthritis usually resolves within 2 weeks but can recur. Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations occur in up to 80% of children with HSP and include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, paralytic ileus, and melena. Intussusception, mesenteric ischemia, and intestinal perforation are rare but serious complications. Endoscopic evaluation is usually not needed but may identify vasculitis of the intestinal tract. Renal involvement occurs in up to 30% of children with HSP, mani- festing as microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, frank nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and acute or chronic renal failure. However, progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is uncommon in children (1-2%) (see Chapter 560.3). Renal manifestations can be delayed for several months after the initial illness, so close follow-up with serial urinalyses and blood pressure monitoring is necessary. Neurologic manifestations of HSP, caused by hypertension (poste- rior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) or central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis, may also occur, including intracerebral hemor- rhage, seizures, headaches, depressed level of consciousness, cranial or peripheral neuropathies, and behavior changes. Other, less common potential manifestations of HSP are inflammatory eye disease, carditis, pulmonary hemorrhage, orchitis, and testicular torsion. DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of HSP is clinical and often straightforward when the typical rash is present. However, in at least 25% of cases, the rash appears after other manifestations, making early diagnosis challenging.

Textbook of Pediatric Rheumatology, 6th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders; 2011. Table 210.6 summarizes the EULAR/PRES classification criteria for HSP. Most patients are afebrile. The differential diagnosis for HSP depends on specific organ involvement, but usually includes other small vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitides (Table 210.7), infections, acute poststreptococcal glomer- ulonephritis, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, coagulopathies, and other acute intraabdominal processes. Additional disorders in the differen- tial include papular-purpuric glove and sock syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), other vasculitides (urticarial, hypersensitivity). and thrombocytopenia. Infantile acute hemorrhagic edema (AHE), an isolated cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis that affects infants <2 years of age, resembles HSP clinically. AHE manifests as fever; tender edema of the face, scro- tum, hands, and feet; and ecchymosis (usually larger than the purpura of HSP) on the face and extremities (Fig. 210.4). The trunk is spared, but petechiae may be seen in mucous membranes. The patient usu- ally appears well except for the rash. The platelet count is normal or elevated, and the urinalysis results are normal. The younger age, nature of the lesions, absence of other organ involvement, and a biopsy may help distinguish infantile AHE from HSP. LABORATORY FINDINGS No laboratory finding is diagnostic of HSP. Common but nonspecific findings include leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, mild anemia, and eleva- tions of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The platelet count is normal in HSP. Occult blood is frequently found in stool specimens. Serum albumin levels may be low because of renal or intestinal nuclear antibody (ANA) is not useful diagnostically except to exclude other diseases. Serum IgA values are often elevated but are not rou- tinely measured. Assessment of renal involvement with blood pressure, urinalysis, and serum creatinine is necessary. Ultrasound is often used in the setting of GI complaints to look for bowel wall edema or the rare occurrence of an associated intussuscep- tion. Barium enema can also be used to both diagnose and treat intus- susception. Although often unnecessary in typical HSP, biopsies of skin and kidney can provide important diagnostic information, particularly in atypical or severe cases, and characteristically show leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA deposition in affected tissues. TREATMENT Treatment for mild and self-limited HSP is supportive, with an emphasis on ensuring adequate hydration, nutrition, and analgesia. Corticosteroids are most often used to treat significant GI involve- ment or other life-threatening manifestations. Glucocorticoids such as oral prednisone (1-2 mg/kg/day), or in severe cases, intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone for 1-2 weeks, followed by taper, reduce abdominal and joint pain but do not alter the overall prognosis. Cor- ticosteroids are not routinely recommended for prevention of compli- cations such as nephritis. Rapid tapering of corticosteroids may lead to a flare of HSP symptoms. Although few data are available to dem- onstrate efficacy, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange are sometimes used for severe disease. In some patients, chronic HSP renal disease is managed with a variety of immunosup- pressants, including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil. ESRD develops in <5% of children with HSP nephritis. COMPLICATIONS Acutely, serious GI involvement, including intussusception and intes- tinal perforation, imparts signifcant morbidity and mortality. Renal disease is the major long-term complication, occurring in 1-2% of children with HSP. Renal disease can develop up to 6 months after diagnosis but rarely does so if the initial urinalysis findings are normal. Therefore, it is recommended that children with HSP undergo serial monitoring of blood pressure and urinalysis for at least 6 months after diagnosis to monitor for development of nephritis. PROGNOSIS Overall, the prognosis for childhood HSP is excellent, and most children experience an acute, self-limited course lasting on average 4 weeks. However, 15-60% of children with HSP experience one or more recurrences, typically within 4-6 months of diagnosis. With each relapse, symptoms are usually milder than at presentation. Children

In any pediatric patient with ongoing or a history of unexplained systemic inflammation, the diagnosis of systemic vasculitis should be considered and referral to a pediatric rheumatologist should be made, particularly in the presence of unexplained organ involvement. 2. Clinical features combined with laboratory evidence of inflammation that suggest a vasculitic syndrome warranting referral to a pediatric rheumatologist are included in the following nonexhaustive list: • Pyrexia of unknown origin • Vasculitic skin rash • PNS or CNS involvement • Unexplained arthritis, myalgia, serositis • Unexplained pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or renal 3. When vasculitis is suspected, the diagnosis is often difficult and differential diagnoses are broad. The general workup for diagnosis of a specific vasculitic syndrome should include tissue histology, imaging, and determination of ANCA. 4. In every patient in whom a specific vasculitic syndrome is suspected, basic screening investigations, along with blood pressure measurement, should include: • Hematology and acute-phase reactants: • Full blood count, ESR, CRP, clotting, prothrombotic screen (if patchy ischemia of digits or skin) • Peripheral blood smear • Basic biochemistry: • Renal function, liver function, CPK, LDH • Urine dipstick test of urine with UA:UC ratio or UP:UC ratio • Infection: • Routine pediatric infection screen • Anti-streptolysin O antibody titer (ASOT) and/or anti-DNase b • VZV antibody status • Immunologic tests: • ANA, ENA antibodies, ANCA, antiphospholipid antibodies • Immunoglobulins IgG/IgA/IgM/lgE • Complement (C3, C4) • RF (if nephritis or interstitial lung disease) • GBM antibody • Radiologic/other: • CXR| • Doppler abdominal ultrasound scan • ECG; echocardiography 5.

In the clinical assessment of suspected systemic vasculitis, a structured multiorgan assessment should take place. 7. For suspected systemic vasculitis, the Pediatric Vasculitis Activity Score (PVAS) may facilitate structured multiorgan assessment. The PVAS can be found here: http://ard.bmj.com/content/72/10/1628.short 8. At diagnosis and in ongoing follow-up of systemic vasculitis, a PVAS score should be performed to assess disease activity. 9.

The long- term prognosis usually depends on the severity and duration of GI or renal involvement. Chronic renal disease develops in 1-2% of children with HSP, and <5% of those with HSP nephritis go on to have ESRD.

Most children are diagnosed as Chapter 210 • Vasculitis Syndromes 1557 Table 210.6 Classification Criteria for Henoch-Schönlein Purpura* EUROPEAN LEAGUE AGAINST RHEUMATISM/PEDIATRIC RHEUMATOLOGY EUROPEAN SOCIETY CRITERIA Palpable purpura (in absence of coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia) and one or more of the following criteria must be present: • Abdominal pain (acute, diffuse, colicky pain) • Arthritis or arthralgia • Biopsy of affected tissue demonstrating predominant IgA deposition • Renal involvement (proteinuria >0.3 g/24 hr), hematuria, or red cell casts *Classification criteria are developed for use in research and are not validated for clinical diagnosis. †Developed for use in pediatric populations only.

Up to 20% of individuals with TA are diagnosed before 19 years. Younger children may be affected, but diagnosis in infancy is rare. TA preferentially affects females, with a reported 2-4:1 female/male ratio in children and adolescents and a 9:1 ratio among adults. Occlusive complications are more common in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, whereas aneurysms pre- dominate in Southeast Asia and Africa. PATHOLOGY TA is characterized by inflammation of the vessel wall, starting in the vasa vasorum. Involved vessels are infiltrated by T cells, natural killer cells, plasma cells, and macrophages. Giant cells and granulomatous inflammation develop in the media. Persistent inflammation dam- ages the elastic lamina and muscular media, leading to blood vessel

Textbook of Neonatal Dermatology. Philadelphia: Saunders; 2001.) dilation and the formation of aneurysms. Progressive scarring and inti- mal proliferation can result in stenotic or occluded vessels. The sub- clavian, renal, and carotid arteries are the most commonly involved aortic branches; pulmonary, coronary, and vertebral arteries may also be affected. PATHOGENESIS The etiology of TA remains unknown. The presence of abundant T cells with a restricted repertoire of T-cell receptors in TA vascular lesions points to the importance of cellular immunity and suggests the exis- tence of a specific but unknown aortic tissue antigen. Expression of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a is reported to be higher in patients with active TA than in patients with inactive TA and in healthy controls. In some patient populations, IL-1 genetic poly- morphisms are linked to TA. Some individuals with TA have elevated serum values of antiendothelial antibodies. The increased prevalence of TA in certain ethnic populations and its occasional occurrence in monozygotic twins and families suggest a genetic predisposition to the disease. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS The diagnosis of TA is challenging because early disease manifesta- tions are often nonspecific. As a result, diagnosis can be delayed for several months, and the time to diagnosis is usually longer in chil- dren than in adults. Fever, malaise, weight loss, headache, hyperten- sion, myalgias, arthralgias, dizziness, and abdominal pain are common early complaints in the prepulseless phase of the disease. Among chil- dren, hypertension and headache are particularly common presenting manifestations and should prompt consideration of TA when present without alternative explanation. Some individuals with TA report no systemic symptoms and instead present with vascular complications. It is only after substantial vascular injury that evidence of hypoperfu- sion becomes clinically evident. Later manifestations of disease include diminished pulse, asymmetric blood pressure, claudication, Raynaud phenomenon, renal failure, and symptoms of pulmonary or cardiac ischemia. Inflammation can extend to the aortic valve, resulting in valvular insufficiency. Other findings may include pericardial effusion, pericarditis, pleuritis, splenomegaly, and arthritis. Supradiaphragmatic (aortic arch) disease often manifests with CNS (stroke, transient ischemic attack) and cardiac (heart failure, palpita- tions) symptoms. Infradiaphragmatic (midaortic syndrome) disease may produce hypertension, abdominal bruits, and pain. Most patients have involvement in both areas. DIAGNOSIS Specific pediatric criteria for TA have been proposed (Table 210.8). The 2022 ACR/ EULAR classification criteria for Takayasu arteritis propose a criterion-based scoring system in adults (Table 210.9). Radiographic demonstration of large vessel vasculitis is necessary. A thorough physi- cal examination is required to detect an aortic murmur, diminished or asymmetric pulses, and vascular bruits. Four extremity blood pres- sures should be measured; > 10 mm Hg asymmetry in systolic pressure is indicative of disease. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS In the early phase of TA, when nonspecific symptoms predominate, the differential diagnosis includes a wide array of systemic infections, auto- immune conditions, and malignancies. Although giant cell arteritis, also known as temporal arteritis, is a common large vessel vasculitis in older adults, this entity is rare in childhood. Noninflammatory conditions that can cause large vessel compromise include fibromus- cular dysplasia, Marfan syndrome, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. LABORATORY FINDINGS The laboratory findings in TA are nonspecific, and there is no specific diagnostic laboratory test. ESR and CRP values are typically elevated, and other nonspecific markers of chronic inflammation may include leuko- cytosis, thrombocytosis, anemia of chronic inflammation, and hyper- gammaglobulinemia. Autoantibodies, including ANA and ANCA, are not useful in diagnosing TA except to help exclude other autoimmune diseases. Radiographic assessment is essential to establish large vessel arterial involvement. Conventional arteriography of the aorta and major branches, including carotid, subclavian, pulmonary, renal, and mesenteric branches, can identity luminal defects, including dilation, aneurysms, and steno- ses, even in smaller vessels such as the mesenteric arteries. Figure 210.5 shows a conventional arteriogram in a child with TA. Although not yet thoroughly validated in TA, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) also provide important information about vessel wall thickness and enhancement, although they may not image smaller vessels as well as conventional angiography. Posi- tron emission tomography (PET) may detect vessel wall inflammation but has not been studied extensively. Ultrasound with duplex color flow Doppler imaging may identify vessel wall thickening and assesses arte- rial flow. Echocardiography is recommended to assess for aortic valvular

Serial vascular imaging is usually necessary to assess response to treatment and to detect progressive vascular damage. TREATMENT Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of therapy, typically starting with high doses (1-2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or methylprednisolone IV) followed by gradual dosage tapering. When TA progresses or recurs, steroid- sparing therapy is often required, usually involving methotrexate or aza- thioprine. Cyclophosphamide is reserved for severe or refractory disease. Results of small case series also suggest that mycophenolate mofetil or anti-TNF-a therapy may be beneficial in select patients. Anti-IL-6 ther- apy with tocilizumab has shown promising results in a small case series Fig. 210.5 Child with Takayasu arteritis. Conventional angiogram shows massive bilateral carotid dilation, stenosis, and poststenotic dilation. of children with TA. Antihypertensive medications are often necessary to control blood pressure caused by renovascular disease. COMPLICATIONS Progressive vascular damage can result in arterial stenoses, aneurysms, and occlusions, which produce ischemic symptoms and can be organ or life threatening. Potential ischemic complications include stroke, renal impairment or failure, myocardial infarction, mesenteric isch- emia, and limb-threatening arterial disease. When these complications occur or are imminent, intervention with surgical vascular grafting or catheter-based angioplasty and stent placement may be necessary to restore adequate blood flow. A high rate of recurrent stenosis has been reported after angioplasty and stent placement. Aortic valve replace- ment may be required if significant aortic insufficiency develops. PROGNOSIS Although up to 20% of individuals with TA have a monophasic course and achieve sustained remission, most suffer relapses. Survival for indi- viduals with TA has improved considerably over the decades, although higher mortality rates are reported in children and adolescents. The overall estimated survival for individuals with TA is 93% at 5 years and 87% at 10 years. However, morbidity from vascular complications remains high, particularly when there is evidence of ongoing active inflammation as detected by elevated CRP or ESR. Given the chronic endothelial insult and inflammation, children and adolescents with TA are probably at high risk for accelerated atherosclerosis. Early detection and treatment are critical to optimizing outcomes in TA. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. 

1560 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) 210.3 Polyarteritis Nodosa and Cutaneous Polyarteritis Nodosa Vidya Sivaraman, Edward C. Fels, and Stacy P. Ardoin Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis affect- ing small and medium-size arteries. Aneurysms and stenoses form at irregular intervals throughout affected arteries. Cutaneous PAN is lim- ited to the skin. EPIDEMIOLOGY PAN is rare in childhood. Males and females are equally affected, and the mean age at presentation is 9 years. The cause is unknown, but the development of PAN after infections, including group A streptococcus and chronic hepatitis B, suggests that PAN may represent a postinfec- tious autoimmune response. Infections with other organisms, including Epstein-Barr virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus, parvovi- rus B19, and hepatitis C virus, have also been associated with PAN. There is a possible association between PAN and familial Mediterranean fever. PATHOLOGY Biopsies show necrotizing vasculitis with granulocytes and monocytes infiltrating the walls of small and medium-size arteries. Involvement is usually segmental and tends to occur at vessel bifurcations. Granulomatous inflammation is not present, and deposition of complement and immune complexes is rarely observed. Different stages of inflammation are found, ranging from mild inflammatory changes to panmural fibrinoid necrosis associated with aneurysm formation, thrombosis, and vascular occlusion. PATHOGENESIS Immune complexes are believed to be pathogenic, but the mechanism is poorly understood. It is not known why PAN has a predilection for small and medium-size blood vessels. The inflamed vessel wall becomes thickened and narrowed, impeding blood flow and contributing to end-organ damage characteristic of this disease. Although there is no clear genetic association with PAN, PAN-like vasculitis is a component of three recently described monogenic autoinflammatory conditions. Deficiency in adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2), caused by muta- tions in the CECR1 gene, causes a familial form of vasculitis with an autosomal recessive inheritance (see Chapter 204). Fig. 210.6 Purpuric and necrotic lesions on the legs of a child with polyarteritis nodosa. (From Petty RE, Laxer RM, Lindsley CB, et al., eds. Textbook of Pediatric Rheumatology, 8th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2021: Fig. 34.1, p. 468.) CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS The clinical presentation of PAN is variable but generally reflects the distribution of inflamed vessels. Constitutional symptoms are present in most children at disease onset. Weight loss and severe abdominal pain suggest mesenteric arterial inflammation and ischemia. Reno- vascular arteritis can cause hypertension, hematuria, or proteinuria, although glomerulonephritis is not typical. Cutaneous manifestations include purpura, livedo reticularis, ulcerations, digital ischemia, and painful nodules (Fig. 210.6). Arteritis affecting the nervous system can result in cerebrovascular accidents, transient ischemic attacks, psycho- sis, and ischemic motor or sensory peripheral neuropathy (mononeu- ritis multiplex). Myocarditis or coronary arteritis can lead to heart failure and myocardial ischemia; pericarditis and arrhythmias have also been reported. Arthralgias, arthritis, or myalgias are frequently present. Less common symptoms include testicular pain that mimics testicular torsion, bone pain, and vision loss as a result of retinal arteri- tis. The pulmonary vasculature is usually spared in PAN. DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of PAN requires demonstration of vessel involvement on biopsy or angiography (Table 210.10). Biopsy of cutaneous lesions shows small or medium vessel vasculitis. Kidney biopsy in patients with renal manifestations may show necrotizing arteritis. Electromyography in children with peripheral neuropathy identifies affected nerves, and sural nerve biopsy may reveal vasculitis. Conventional arteriography is the gold-standard diagnostic imaging study for PAN and reveals areas of aneurysmal dilation and segmental stenosis, the classic "beads on a string" appearance (Fig. 210.7). MRA and CTA, less invasive imaging alternatives, are gaining acceptance but may not be as effective in iden- tifying small vessel disease or in younger children. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Early skin lesions may resemble those of HSP, although the finding of nodular lesions and the presence of systemic features help distinguish PAN. Because pulmonary vascular involvement is very rare in PAN, pulmonary lesions suggest ANCA-associated vasculitis or Goodpasture disease. Other rheumatic diseases, including SLE, have characteristic target-organ involvement and associated autoantibodies distinguishing them from PAN. Prolonged fever and weight loss should also prompt consideration of inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy. Deficiency of DADA2 is a mimic of PAN and should be suspected in the presence of vasculitic rash (Fig. 210.8), hypogammaglobulinemia, cytopenias, and strokes. In addition, SAVI (STING-associated vascu- lopathy with onset in infancy) presents in infancy with ulcerating skin lesions that form eschars, cytopenias, interstitial lung disease, and fail- ure to thrive (see Chapter 204). LABORATORY FINDINGS Nonspecific laboratory findings include elevations of ESR and CRP, anemia, leukocytosis, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Abnormal urine sediment, proteinuria, and hematuria indicate renal disease. Labora- tory findings may be normal in cutaneous PAN or similar to those of systemic PAN. Elevated hepatic enzyme values may suggest hepatitis B or C infection. Serologic tests for hepatitis (hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody) should be performed in all patients.

TREATMENT Oral prednisone (1-2 mg/kg/day) or IV pulse methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) are the mainstay of therapy.

(From Petty RE, Laxer RM, Lindsley CB, et al., eds. Textbook of Pediatric Rheumatology, 8th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2021, Fig. 34.3, p. 469.) be warranted for life-threatening disease. If hepatitis B is identified, appropriate antiviral therapy should be initiated (see Chapter 406). Most cases of cutaneous PAN can be treated with less intense therapy such as corticosteroids alone, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and methotrexate. Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, IVIG, thalidomide, cyclosporine, and anti-TNF agents such as inflix- imab have all been reported as successful in the treatment of refractory cutaneous or systemic PAN. If an infectious trigger for PAN is identi- fied, antibiotic prophylaxis can be considered. COMPLICATIONS Cutaneous nodules may ulcerate and become infected. Hypertension and chronic renal disease may develop from renovascular involvement in PAN. Cardiac involvement may lead to decreased cardiac func- tion or coronary artery disease. Mesenteric vasculitis can predispose to bowel infarction, rupture, and malabsorption. Stroke and rupture of hepatic arterial aneurysm are uncommon complications of this disorder. PROGNOSIS The course of PAN varies from mild disease with few complications to a severe, multiorgan disease with high morbidity and mortality. Poor prog- nostic factors in PAN include elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria, severe GI involvement, cardiomyopathy, and CNS involvement. Early and aggressive immunosuppressive therapy increases the likelihood of clinical remission. Compared with disease in adults, childhood PAN is associated with less mortality. Cutaneous PAN is unlikely to transition to systemic disease. Early recognition and treatment of the disease are important to minimizing potential long-term vascular complications.

Fig. 1. formerly Wegener granulomatosis; microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (Table 210.12); and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis Table 210.13), formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). The 2022 ACR/ EULAR classification criteria for adults with GPA, MPA and EGPA employ a criterion-based scoring system for classification of these vasculitides. EPIDEMIOLOGY GPA is a necrotizing, granulomatous, small and medium vessel vascu- litis that occurs at all ages and targets the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the kidneys. Most cases of GPA occur in adults; the disease also occurs in children with a mean age at diagnosis of 14 years. There is a female predominance of 3-4:1, and pediatric GPA is most prevalent in the White population. MPA is a small vessel necrotizing vasculitis with clinical features similar to those of GPA, but without granulomas and upper air- way involvement. CSS is a small vessel necrotizing granulomatous (allergic granulomatosis) vasculitis associated with a history of refractory asthma and peripheral eosinophilia. MPA and CSS are rare in children, and there does not appear to be a gender predilec- tion in either disease. PATHOLOGY Necrotizing vasculitis is the cardinal histologic feature in both GPA and MPA.

Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2021, Fig. 36.7, p. 495. PATHOGENESIS The etiology of ANCA-associated vasculitis remains unknown, although neutrophils, monocytes, and endothelial cells are involved in disease pathogenesis. Neutrophils and monocytes are activated by ANCAs, specifically by the ANCA-associated anti- gens proteinase-3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), and release proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-8. Localization of these inflammatory cells to the endothelium results in vascular damage characteristic of the ANCA vasculitides. Why the respira- tory tract and kidneys are preferential targets in GPA and MPA is CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS The early disease course is characterized by nonspecific constitu- tional symptoms, including fever, malaise, weight loss, myalgias, and arthralgias. In GPA, upper airway involvement can manifest as sinusitis, nasal ulceration, epistaxis, otitis media, and hearing loss. Lower respiratory tract symptoms in GPA include cough, wheez- ing, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. Pulmonary hemorrhage can cause rapid respiratory failure. Compared with adults, childhood GPA is more frequently complicated by subglottic stenosis (Fig. 210.9). Inflammation-induced damage to the nasal cartilage can produce a saddle nose deformity (see Fig. 210.9). Ophthalmic involvement includes conjunctivitis, scleritis, uveitis, optic neuritis, and inva- sive orbital pseudotumor (causing proptosis). Perineural vasculi- pis pereiral vacati, tis or direct compression on nerves by granulomatous lesions can cause cranial and peripheral neuropathies. Hematuria, proteinuria, and hypertension in GPA signal renal disease. Cutaneous lesions include palpable purpura and ulcers. Venous thromboembolism is a rare but potentially fatal complication of GPA. The frequencies of Chapter 210 • Vasculitis Syndromes 1563 organ system involvement throughout the disease course in GPA are as follows: respiratory tract, 74%; kidneys, 83%; joints, 65%; eyes, 43%; skin, 47%; sinuses, 70%; and nervous system, 20%. Table 210.11 lists the classification criteria for pediatric-onset GPA. The clinical presentation of MPA closely resembles that of GPA, although sinus disease is less common; systemic features of fever, mal- aise, weight loss, myalgias, and arthralgias may be dominant. MPA pre- dominantly affects the kidney and lungs; other organ systems include skin, CNS, muscle, heart, and eyes (see Table 210.12). CSS frequently causes inflammation of the upper and lower respira- tory tracts, but cartilage destruction is rare. CSS may initially demon- strate chronic or recurrent rhinitis/sinusitis, nasal polyposis, nonfixed pulmonary lesions, and difficult-to-treat asthma. Eosinophilia (>10% of leukocytes) with pulmonary infiltrates may precede a vasculitic phase. Other organ involvement includes skin, cardiac, peripheral neu- ropathy, GI tract, and muscle. Renal involvement in CSS is uncommon. DIAGNOSIS GPA should be considered in children who have recalcitrant sinusitis, pulmonary infltrates, and evidence of nephritis. Chest radiography often fails to detect pulmonary lesions, and chest CT may show nod- ules, ground-glass opacities, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and cavi- tary lesions (Fig. 210.10). The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of c-ANCA with anti-PR3 specificity (PR3-ANCAs) and the finding of nec- rotizing granulomatous vasculitis on pulmonary, sinus, or renal biopsy. The ANCA test result is positive in approximately 90% of children with GPA, and the presence of anti-PR3 increases the specificity of the test. In MPA, ANCAs are also frequently present (70% of patients) but are usually p-ANCA with reactivity to MPO (MPO-ANCAs). MPA can be distinguished from PAN by the presence of ANCAs and the tendency for small vessel involvement. The ANCA test result is positive in 50-70% of cases of CSS, and MPO-ANCAs are more common than PR3-ANCAs. In addition, the presence of chronic asthma and periph- eral eosinophilia suggests the diagnosis of CSS. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS ANCAs are absent in other granulomatous diseases, such as sarcoid- osis and tuberculosis. Goodpasture syndrome is characterized by antibodies to glomerular basement membrane. Medications such as propylthiouracil, hydralazine, and minocycline are associated with drug-induced ANCA (usually perinuclear ANCA) vasculitis. SLE and HSP can manifest as pulmonary hemorrhage and nephritis. LABORATORY FINDINGS Nonspecific laboratory abnormalities include elevated ESR and CRP values, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis, which are present in most patients with an ANCA-associated vasculitis but are nonspecific. Anemia may be caused by chronic inflammation or pulmonary hem- orrhage. ANCA antibodies show two distinct immunofluorescence patterns: perinuclear (p-ANCA) and cytoplasmic (c-ANCA). In addition, ANCAs can be defined by their specificity for PR3 or MPO antigen. GPA is strongly associated with c-ANCAs/anti-PR3 antibodies, whereas 75% of patients with MPA have a positive p-ANCA. There is no clear correla- tion between ANCA titers and disease activity or relapse. TREATMENT When the lower respiratory tract or kidneys are significantly involved, initial induction therapy usually consists of prednisone (oral 2 mg/ kg/day oral or IV methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day x 3 days) in con- junction with daily oral or monthly IV cyclophosphamide. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody to CD20 on activated B cells, is an option for induction therapy in ANCA-positive vasculitides, although it has been studied primarily in adults. Plasmapheresis in conjunction with meth- yprednisolone has a role in the therapy of patients with severe disease manifestations such as pulmonary hemorrhage or ESRD, with the poten- tial for reducing dialysis dependency. Patients are transitioned to a less toxic maintenance medication (usually methotrexate, azathioprine, or

The Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance has pub- lished treatment guidelines for the induction and maintenance therapy of children with severe ANCA-associated vasculitides consisting of induc- tion therapy with cyclophosphamide or rituximab and maintenance therapy with rituximab, methotrexate, or azathioprine. Trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (one 160 mg/800 mg tablet 3 days/week) is often pre- scribed both for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii infection and to reduce upper respiratory bacterial colonization with S. aureus, which may trigger disease activity. If disease is limited to the upper respiratory tract, corticosteroids (1-2 mg/kg/day) and methotrexate (0.5-1.0 mg/kg/ week may be first-line treatment. Avacopan, a C5a receptor inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in reducing the need for corticosteroids in addition to standard therapy in adults with ANCA-associated vasculitis but has not been studied in children. Mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, may have a role in the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (CSS). COMPLICATIONS Upper respiratory tract lesions can invade the orbit and threaten the optic nerve, and lesions in the ear can cause permanent hearing loss. Respiratory complications include potentially life-threatening pulmo- nary hemorrhage and upper airway obstruction caused by subglottic stenosis. Chronic lung disease secondary to granulomatous inflamma- tion, cavitary lesions, and scarring can predispose to infectious compli- cations. Chronic glomerulonephritis may progress to ESRD in a subset of patients with advanced or undertreated disease. PROGNOSIS The course is variable, but disease relapse occurs in up to 60% of patients. Mortality has been reduced with the introduction of cyclo- phosphamide and other immunosuppressive agents. Compared with adults, children are more likely to develop multiorgan involvement, renal involvement, and subglottic stenosis. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. 

210.5 Other Vasculitis Syndromes: Hypersensitivity, CNS, and COVID-19 Related Vidya Sivaraman, Edward C. Fels, and Stacy P. Ardoin Other vasculitic conditions can occur in childhood; the most common is Kawasaki disease (see Chapter 208). Behçet disease is a rare form of vasculitis seen in children of Turkish and Mediterranean descent, char- acterized by the triad of recurrent aphthous stomatitis, genital ulcers, and uveitis (see Chapter 202). Hypersensitivity vasculitis is a cutaneous vasculitis triggered by medication or toxin exposure. The rash consists of palpable pur- pura or other nonspecific rash. Skin biopsies reveal characteristic changes of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (small vessels with neutro- philic perivascular or extravascular neutrophilic infiltration) (Table 210.14). Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis involves small vessels and manifests as recurrent urticaria that resolves over several days but leaves residual hyperpigmentation. This condition is associated with low levels of complement component Clq and systemic findings that include fever, GI symptoms, arthritis, and glomerulonephritis. Some patients with urticarial vasculitis have normal complement levels. Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis can com- plicate mixed essential cryoglobulinemia and is a small vessel vas- culitis affecting skin, joints, kidneys, and lungs. Primary angiitis of the central nervous system represents vas- culitis confined to the CNS and requires exclusion of other systemic vasculitides. Large vessel disease (angiography positive) may be progressive or nonprogressive and may manifest with focal deficits similar to an occlusive stroke, with hemiparesis, focal gross or fine motor deficits, language disorders, or cranial nerve deficits. Diffuse cognitive, memory, and concentration deficits and behavioral dis- orders are seen in 30-40% of patients. Small vessel disease (angi- ography negative, biopsy positive) more often results in language problems and diffuse deficits, such as cognitive, memory, behavior, and concentration problems, as well as focal seizures. In both types Table 210.14 Criteria for Diagnosis of Hypersensitivity Vasculitis* CRITERION Age at onset > 16yr Medication at disease onset Palpable purpura Maculopapular rash DEFINITION Development of symptoms after 16yr of age Medication that may have been a precipitating factor was taken at the onset of symptoms Slightly elevated purpuric rash over one or more areas; does not blanch with pressure and is not related to thrombocytopenia Flat and raised lesions of various sizes over one or more areas of the skin Biopsy, including arteriole and venule Histologic changes showing granulocytes in a perivascular or extravascular location *For purposes of classification, a patient is said to have hypersensitivity vasculitis if at least three of these criteria are present. The presence of three or more criteria has a diagnostic sensitivity of 71.0% and specificity of 83.9%. The age criterion is not applicable for children.

Cogan syndrome is rare in children; its potential clinical manifestations include con- stitutional symptoms; inflammatory eye disease such as uveitis, episcleritis, or interstitial keratitis; vestibuloauditory dysfunction (vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus); arthritis; and large vessel vasculitis or aortitis. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with sub- cortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is caused by pathogenic variants in the NOTCH3 gene and manifests with stroke, mood changes, cognitive decline, and migraines; it is a vas- culitis mimic and demonstrates osmophilic granules in cerebral arteries. Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL) is another mimic of angiitis caused by pathogenic variants in the HTRA1 gene. It mani- fests with early-onset hair loss, spasticity, stroke, memory loss, and personality changes. Identification of these vasculitis syndromes requires a compre- hensive history and physical examination. Table 210.16 outlines other diagnostic considerations. Although tailored to disease sever- ity, treatment generally includes prednisone (up to 2 mg/kg/day). Potent immunosuppressive medications, such as cyclophospha- mide, are often indicated, particularly in primary angiitis of the CNS to prevent rapid neurologic decline. For hypersensitivity vas- culitis, withdrawal of the triggering medication or toxin is indicated if possible. COVID-19, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), has been associated with a variety of cutaneous lesions that resemble vasculitis, vasculopathy, and vasoocclusive etiologies (see Chapter 311) (Table 210.17, Fig. 210.11). Lesions include pernio (chilblain: COVID toes)-like lesions suggestive of a vasculitis. Other cutaneous manifestations include urticarial vascu- litis and livedo reticularis-like or livedo racemosa-both resemble a pauci-inflammatory occlusive vasculitis. Sweet syndrome and erythema multiforme-like lesions have also been described. Most cutaneous lesions associated with known COVID-19 or MIS-C do not require a biopsy, but some of those that were biopsied have demonstrated a leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Chapter 211 Musculoskeletal Pain Syndromes James J. Nocton Musculoskeletal pain is a frequent reason for children to visit a health- care provider and is the most common problem referred to pediatric rheumatology clinics. Prevalence estimates of persistent musculoskel- etal pain in community samples range from 10% to 40%. Although inflammatory diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are associated with musculoskel- etal pain, noninflammatory conditions such as trauma, hypermobil- ity, overuse, and idiopathic pain syndromes are much more common causes of musculoskeletal pain in children. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Acute and subacute musculoskeletal pain in children is most com- monly the result of trauma, overuse, hypermobility, or some combi- nation of these. The history and physical findings of trauma are most often readily apparent, and the pain associated with overuse or hyper- mobility is most often described as related to activities and improving with rest. The physical examination of children with pain related to overuse, hypermobility, and other mechanical causes of pain does not reveal signs of inflammation such as warmth, swelling, or limited range of motion and most often reveals hypermobility with perhaps mild ten- derness over tendons and their insertion points. Chronic idiopathic musculoskeletal pain syndromes are defined by pain of at least 3 months duration in the absence of objective abnor- malities on physical examination or laboratory screening (see Chapter 212). The prevalence of chronic idiopathic musculoskeletal pain syn- dromes increases with age and is higher in females. These syndromes often persist despite treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other analgesics. Chronic pain may occur any- where and is most often diffuse and poorly localized, but may some- times involve only a single extremity or part of an extremity. Pain may start in one location before potentially developing in other areas over time. Psychologic and emotional distress, including anxiety, depres- sion, stress, or a combination of these, is quite common in those with chronic idiopathic musculoskeletal pain syndromes. Frequent cry- ing, school and social stress, poor concentration, and excessive worry are often described. Sleep disturbance in children with chronic pain syndromes may include difficulty falling asleep, multiple night awak- enings, disrupted sleep-wake cycles with increased daytime sleeping, nonrestorative sleep, and fatigue. Children who are high achievers, excellent students, mature, and responsible, with high expectations of themselves have a predisposition to the development of pain syndromes in general, including chronic musculoskeletal pain. As a result, headaches and abdominal pain or other gastrointestinal symptoms are also frequently present in those with chronic idiopathic musculoskeletal pain syndromes. The constellation of chronic pain, psychologic distress, and sleep dis- turbance often leads to a high degree of functional impairment. Poor school attendance is common, and children may struggle to complete other daily activities relating to self-care and participation in household chores. Decreased physical fitness can also occur, along with changes in gait and posture, as children avoid the use of the area affected by pain. Peer relationships may also be disrupted by decreased opportunities tor social interaction because of pain. Loneliness and social isolation characterized by few friends and lack of participation in extracurricu- lar activities are common. Chapter 211 • Musculoskeletal Pain Syndromes 1567 DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of a musculoskeletal pain syndrome is based primar- ily on history and physical examination. Children with pain require a thorough clinical history, including a complete social history and review of systems, and a careful, comprehensive physical examination. The specific characteristics of the pain should be defined, evidence of potential systemic disease should be sought, and any additional associ- ated symptoms and signs should be elicited. The need for laboratory testing and imaging studies should be indi- vidualized, depending on the information elicited in the history and discovered with the physical examination. Possible indicators of an inflammatory cause for musculoskeletal pain include objective joint warmth, swelling, limited range of joint motion on physical examina- tion, localized bone tenderness, and muscle weakness; potential indica- tors of a systemic disease include poor linear growth, weight loss, and constitutional symptoms. The lack of these symptoms and objective abnormalities on physical examination is more suggestive of a non- inflammatory cause for pain (Table 211.1). The complete blood count (CBC) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often abnormal in children whose pain is secondary to a bone or joint infection, rheu- matic disease, or a malignancy. Bone tumors, fractures, and other focal pathology resulting from infection, malignancy, or trauma can often be identified through imaging studies, including plain radiographs or The presence of chronic, persistent pain, accompanied by psycho- logic distress, sleep disturbance, and/or functional impairment, in the absence of objective laboratory or physical examination abnormali- ties, suggests the diagnosis of an idiopathic musculoskeletal pain syndrome. Table 211.2 outlines common causes of pediatric muscu- loskeletal pain according to anatomic location, including growing pains (see Chapter 211.1), diffuse amplified pain syndromes and chronic widespread pain (see Chapter 211.3), complex regional pain syndrome (see Chapter 211.4), localized pain syndromes, low back pain, and chronic overuse-related pain (e.g., Osgood-Schlatter dis- ease). A differential diagnosis of more serious conditions is noted in TREATMENT The primary goal of treatment for acute and subacute musculoskele- tal pain related to trauma, hypermobility, overuse, or other mechan- ical factors is to minimize the discomfort as much as possible and to promote normal activities. Rest, topical analgesics, mechanical joint support to be worn with activities, ice, oral analgesics, and physical therapy may all be used. Education of children and families regard- ing pain related to these mechanical factors is critical in helping them to understand what to expect. Although it is common for the discomfort related to hypermobility and overuse to be recurrent, the prognosis for these mechanical pains is excellent, and most children learn to manage their discomfort with few, if any, restrictions on The primary goal of treatment of chronic idiopathic musculoskel- etal pain syndromes is to improve function and relieve pain; these outcomes may not occur simultaneously or quickly. Pain may persist even as children resume normal function (e.g., increased school atten- dance and participation in extracurricular activities). For all children and adolescents with pediatric musculoskeletal pain syndromes whose school attendance has been affected by their symptoms, regular school attendance is a primary initial goal. The dual nature of treatment, tar- geting both function and pain, needs to be clearly explained. Children and families need to be supported in disengaging from the sole pursuit of pain relief and embracing the equally imperative goal of improved functioning. Recommended treatment modalities include physical and/or occupa- tional therapy, pharmacologic interventions, and cognitive-behavioral and/or other psychotherapeutic interventions. The overarching goal of physical therapy is to improve children's physical function and should emphasize participation in aggressive but graduated aerobic exercise. Pharmacologic interventions should be used judiciously. Low-dose

Rheum Dis Clin North Am. 2007;33:625-660, Box 1. tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline 0.1 mg/kg at bedtime; can increase to 0.5 to 2 mg/kg as tolerated) may improve sleep; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (sertraline 25-100 mg daily) may help to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety if present. Cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or other psychotherapeutic interven- tions are designed to teach children and adolescents coping skills for controlling the behavioral, cognitive, and physiologic responses to pain. Specific components often include cognitive restructuring, relax- ation, distraction, and problem-solving skills. Parent education and involvement in the psychologic intervention are important to ensure maintenance of progress. More intensive family-based approaches are warranted if barriers to treatment success are identified at the family level. These could include parenting strategies or family dynamics that serve to maintain children's pain complaints, such as overly solicitous responses to the child's pain and maladaptive models for coping with pain. COMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS Musculoskeletal pain related to hypermobility and/or overuse may be recurrent and related to specific activities, but is typically mild, does not usually significantly limit activities, and is most often managed symptomatically. Conversely, chronic idiopathic musculoskeletal pain syndromes have a much greater potential to negatively affect develop- ment and future role functioning. Worsening pain and the symptoms of depression and anxiety associated with chronic pain can lead to substantial school absences, peer isolation, and developmental delays later in adolescence and early adulthood. Specifically, adolescents with chronic idiopathic musculoskeletal pain syndromes may fail to achieve the level of autonomy and independence necessary for age-appropriate activities, such as attending college, living away from home, and main- taining a job. Fortunately, not all children and adolescents with these syndromes experience this degree of impairment. Factors that contrib- ute to the persistence of pain are increasingly understood and include female gender, pubertal stage at pain onset, older age of pain onset, increased psychologic distress associated with the pain, and greater functional impairment. The likelihood of positive health outcomes is increased with multidisciplinary treatment addressing the pain, the functional disabilities, and the psychologic comorbidities associated with pain.

Nocton The cause of benign limb pain of childhood, historically referred to as growing pains, is unknown. Low pain threshold, overuse, and behavioral causes have been postulated, and it is possible that there are multiple causes for these pains. This pain affects 10-20% of children, with peak incidence between age 4 and 12 years. Benign limb pains of childhood are intermittent and usually bilateral, poorly localized, and predominantly affecting the anterior thigh, shin, and calf. Occasionally, bilateral upper extremity pain may be associated with leg pain. Chil- dren typically describe cramping or aching that occurs most often in the late afternoon or evening. Pain may wake the child from sleep, may be severe, and may last a few minutes to hours, but typically resolves quickly with massage or analgesics; pain is nearly always resolved by the following morning (Table 211.4). Pain may often follow a day with increased or excessive physical activity. Physical examination is nor- mal, and gait is not impaired. Chapter 211 • Musculoskeletal Pain Syndromes 1569 Treatment should focus on reassurance, education, and healthy sleep hygiene while preparing parents and children for the possibility that the pain may occur intermittently for years, with eventual reso- lution. Massage, acetaminophen, or NSAIDs during the episode are nearly always effective. Restless legs syndrome (RLS), seen more frequently among ado- lescents and adults, is a sensorimotor disturbance that may be con- fused with growing pains (see Chapter 31). Often familial, RLS is a difficult-to-control urge to move the leg that is exacerbated during rest and at night and is relieved by movement (see Table 211.4). There is significant overlap in the diagnostic features of growing pains and RLS. Moreover, these conditions can be comorbid, and there is a high incidence of RLS in the parents of children with growing pains. RLS appears to be best distinguished from growing pains by the urge to move the legs, associated uncomfortable leg sensations that may not be described as painful; worsening with periods of rest; and relief through movement. Iron supplementation may benefit pediatric patients with RLS. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. 211.2 Small Fiber Polyneuropathy James J. Nocton Some patients with juvenile-onset widespread pain syndromes have evidence of a small fiber polyneuropathy causing dysfunctional or degeneration of small-diameter unmyelinated C fibers and thinly myelinated A delta fibers that mediate nociception and the autonomic nervous system. In addition to pain, these children may have dizziness, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), constipation and/ or gastrointestinal dysmotility, and other symptoms suggestive of dys- autonomia (Fig. 211.1). The diagnosis of small fiber polyneuropathy requires distal leg immunolabeled skin biopsy to identify epidermal nociceptive fibers and autonomic function testing to examine cardiovagal, adrenergic, and sudomotor small fiber function. Genetic testing for pathogenic variants in genes coding for sodium channels may reveal SCN9A, SCN10A, or SCN11A variants. Some small studies have reported the presence of autoantibodies to trisulfated disaccharide and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, suggestive of immune-mediated pathogen- esis. Other potential etiologies for small fiber neuropathy are noted in Table 211.5; most cases are idiopathic. In addition, other genetic pain- ful neuropathies should be considered (Table 211.6). Optimal treatment of patients with small fiber polyneuropathy is unknown. Corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin have been effective in very small numbers of patients.

Nocton Diffuse amplified pain syndrome is more common in children than localized amplified pain. In addition to widespread pain, children fre- quently have associated chronic fatigue, sleep disturbance, headaches, chronic abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms, stress, anxi- ety, and/or symptoms of depression (see also Chapter 212). The terms diffuse amplified pain syndrome, chronic widespread pain syndrome, chronic myofascial pain syndrome, and juvenile primary fbromyalgia syndrome are often used to describe the same constellation of symp- toms. Some of these children have findings that fulfill the criteria that have been developed for adult patients with fibromyalgia by either the American College of Rheumatology (Table 211.7) or the Analge- sic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks-American Pain Society (Table 211.8 and

The evaluation of fibromyalgia tender points has not been useful or diagnostic. Although the precise cause of diffuse amplified pain is unknown, there is an emerging understanding that the development and main- tenance of chronic pain are related both to biologic and psychologic factors. Diffuse amplified pain likely has multifactorial causes and is hypothesized to be an abnormality of central pain processing associated with disordered sleep physiology, enhanced pain perception, disor- dered mood, and dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and other neuroendocrine axes, resulting in lower pain thresholds and increased pain sensitivity. Children and adolescents with diffuse amplified pain often find themselves in a vicious cycle of pain, where symptoms build on one another and contribute to the onset and main- tenance of new symptoms. Diffuse amplified pain has a chronic course that can detrimen- tally affect child health and development. Adolescents who do not

Treatment of diffuse amplified pain is ideally multidis- ciplinary. The major goals are to restore function and alleviate pain and to improve comorbid mood and sleep disorders. Treatment strat- egies include parent/child education, pharmacologic interventions, exercise-based interventions, and psychologic interventions. Gradu- ated aerobic exercise is the recommended exercise-based interven- tion, whereas psychologic interventions should include training in pain coping skills, stress management skills, emotional support, and sleep hygiene. CBT is particularly effective in reducing symptoms of depression in children and adolescents with chronic pain and helps to reduce functional disability. Drug therapies, although largely unsuccessful in isolation, may include tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline 0.1 mg/kg at bedtime; can increase to 0.5 to 2 mg/kg as tolerated), selective serotonin reup- take inhibitors (sertraline 25-100 mg daily), and anticonvulsants. Pre- gabalin and duloxetine hydrochloride are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of fibromyalgia in adults (≥18 years of age); however, data regarding the efficacy of these medications in children are limited.

Nocton Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is characterized by chronic, persistent limb pain, often burning in character. CRPS type 1, also termed reflex sympathetic dystrophy, has no evidence of nerve injury, whereas the less common CRPS type 2 is associated with a known mechanism of nerve injury. The pain of CRPS is typically extreme and disproportionate to the inciting event. Associated features include allo- dynia (a heightened pain response to normally non-noxious stimuli), hyperalgesia (exaggerated pain reactivity to noxious stimuli), swell- ing of the affected extremity, and indicators of autonomic dysfunction (cyanosis, mottling, hyperhidrosis). There are no diagnostic criteria specifically for pediatric CRPS; in adults, several sets of criteria have been developed (Table 211.10); the clinical utility of these criteria is controversial. The diagnosis of CRPS is clinical and can be made when continuous pain is present that is dis- proportionate to any potential inciting event with associated allodynia, or hyperalgesia, evidence of edema, skin blood flow abnormalities, or excessive sweating activity, and exclusion of other disorders. Other fea- tures that may be present include atrophy of hair or nails, loss of joint mobility, weakness, tremor, and dystonia. Although many pediatric patients with CRPS present with a history of minor trauma or repeated stress injury (e.g., caused by competitive sports), a significant proportion are unable to identify a precipitating event. Usual age of onset is between 8 and 16 years, and females out- number males with the disease by as much as 6:1. Childhood CRPS differs from the adult form in that lower extremities, rather than upper extremities, are most often affected. The incidence of CRPS in children is unknown, largely because it is often undiagnosed or diag- nosed late. Left untreated, CRPS can have severe consequences for children, including bone demineralization, muscle wasting, and joint The treatment of CRPS, like that of more diffuse pain syndromes, is ideally multidisciplinary. Aggressive physical therapy (PT) should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is made, and CBT added as needed. PT is recommended three to four times a week, and children may need analgesic premedication at the onset, particularly before PT sessions. PT is initially limited to desensitization and then moves to weight bear- ing, range of motion, and other functional activities. CBT used as an adjunctive therapy targets psychosocial obstacles to fully participating in PT and provides pain-coping skills training. The goal of both phar- macologic and adjunctive treatments for CRPS is to provide sufficient pain relief to allow the child to participate in aggressive physical reha- bilitation. Multiple studies have shown that noninvasive treatments, particularly PT and CBT, are at least as efficacious as nerve blocks in helping children with CRPS achieve resolution of their symptoms.

Nocton Children with erythromelalgia experience episodes of intense burning pain, erythema, edema, and heat, most often in the hands and feet (Fig. 211.3) and less frequently in other locations. Symptoms are most often triggered by exposure to heat or exercise and typically last for hours to days. Erythromelalgia is more common in females during adolescence, and the diagnosis is often delayed for many years. Although many cases are sporadic, an autosomal dominant hereditary form results most often from gain-of-function pathogenic variants of the SCN9A gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the sodium channel Nav1.7 found in nociceptive neurons that transmit pain signals.

Jaw, chest, and abdominal pain are not included in generalized pain definition. 3. Symptoms have been generally present for at least 3 mo. ASCERTAINMENT OF WPI The WPl is the number of areas in which a patient has had pain over the last week. The score will be between 0 and 19: Left Upper Region: left jaw, left shoulder girdle, left upper arm, left lower arm; Right Upper Region: right jaw, right shoulder girdle, right upper arm, right lower arm; Left Lower Region: left hip (buttock, trochanter), left upper leg, left lower leg; Right Lower Region: right hip (buttock, trochanter), right upper leg, right lower leg; Axial Region: chest, abdomen, upper back, lower back, and neck. ASCERTAINMENT OF SSS SCORE The SSS score is the sum of the severity of three symptoms (fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms) over the past week (each given a score from 0 to 3) plus the sum of the number of the following symptoms the patient has been bothered by that occurred during the previous 6 mo: headaches, pain or cramps in the lower abdomen, and depression (each given a score from 0 to 1).

1574 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) Chapter 212 Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions Thomas C. Chelimsky and Gisela G. Chelimsky In chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs), several pain- ful symptoms affecting different body systems coexist without clear underlying pathophysiology. Other terms for COPCs include medi- cally unexplained symptoms, functional somatic syndromes (FSS), central sensitivity syndromes. These disorders are probably highly prevalent; for example, two COPCs, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and migraine, each affect 10-20% of the population. Pediatric COPC studies usually focus on populations with one painful condition (headaches) and their psychiatric comorbidities, rather than somatic comorbidities. The overlap of these disorders with psychiatric condi- tions has led both the public and the medical specialists to dichoto- mize these disorders artificially into "physical, by implication, "real" disorders and "psychologic," by implication, "not real" disorders. This classification ignores the unity of brain and body and hinders progress in understanding these disorders. COPC connotes a nonassumptive neutral position, appropriately attributing no assumed ology to the disorder, in contrast to other terms, such as "medically unexplained syndrome," subtly suggesting a psychologic process, more strongly implied in the term "functional." PREVALENCE The prevalence of COPCs is unknown depending on which symp- tom is being assessed and how much overlap exists across disorders. A large study from 28 countries (about 400,000 participants) found a prevalence of headache of 54%, stomachache 50%, and backache 3/%. occurring at least once a month for at least 6 months. Females had a higher prevalence of having all three complaints when compared with males; the prevalence increased with age. These three pain syndromes, headache, stomachache, and backache, frequently coexist. IBS and chronic abdominal pain affect 6-20% of children and adolescents. Idiopathic musculoskeletal pain affects about 16% of schoolchildren age 5-16 years and is often associated with sleep dis- turbances, headache, abdominal pain, daytime tiredness, and feeling sad. Migraines present >6 months occur in about 8% of the popula- tion (children and adolescents <20 years). Fibromyalgia is present in 1.2-6%. The prevalence of chronic disabling fatigue increases during adolescence from about 1.9% at age 13 to 3% at 18 years. As with most COPCs, fibromyalgia has many comorbid disorders, such as sleep dis- turbance, fatigue, headache, sore throat, joint pain, and abdominal pain. The American College of Rheumatology definition of fibromyal- gia incorporates some of these comorbid conditions. SYMPTOM/DISORDER OVERLAP Diagnostic criteria of many of these disorders overlap with one another, making differentiation between two disorders more of a semantic issue rather than a clinical differentiation. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), clinically the most concerning symptom, shares many of the diagnostic criteria with fibromyalgia. Patients with a single pain condition, such as fibromyalgia, CFS, IBS, multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), head- aches, or temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD), will typically have another disorder. This overlap of symptoms may reflect a shared pathophysiology, possibly a central nervous system (CNS) dysfunc- tion, as was implied in the prior term "central sensitization syndrome." A CNS pathophysiology would also explain the "invisibility" of these disorders to usual screening tools that most often target an end organ. COPCs also harbor many symptoms that are not strictly "pain" although they may be equally or more disabling. Adolescents seen in a tertiary referral center with a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) also manifest dizziness, chronic nausea, chronic fatigue, and sleep disturbance, as well as migraines. Up to 50% of adolescents com- plain of weekly fatigue, and 15%, daily fatigue. COPCs are studied in their discipline-specific silos rather than collectively as a group. Migraine headaches are frequently associated with anxiety and depression. Anxiety also predicts the persistence of migraine head- aches. Sleep disturbance and migraine also interact closely. Poor sleep can trigger a migraine or a migraine cluster; migraine headache itself disturbs sleep. Juvenile fibromyalgia is associated with sleep disturbances periodic limb movements. Adult patients with IBS also have sleep disturbances, correlating with anxiety, depression, and stress. The comorbidities of hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos (hEDS) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) with COPC have been significant. Patients with hEDS may complain of widespread and sometimes debilitating pain with or after activity, severe fatigue, hand- writing difficulties, "cracking" of joints, joint swelling, joint dislocation, subluxation, or back pain. The chronic pain reduces exercise tolerance, with poorer quality of life and an ever-worsening cycle because exer- cise is a key piece of management. Patients with FGID may also have hEDS, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and higher somatizations scores than those with organic gastrointestinal (Gl) disorders. The diagnosis of pediatric POTS requires an increase in heart rate >40 beats/min in the first 10 minutes of upright tilt test associated with orthostatic symptoms. POTS is also associated with multiple comorbidities, including sleep disruption, chronic pain, Raynaud-like symptoms, GI abnormalities, and less frequently, headaches, syncope, and urinary complaints. Patients with both POTS and hEDS usually have more migraines and syncope than those with POTS alone. The prevalence of comorbid disorders in children with COPC is identical whether they have POTS or hEDS. PSYCHIATRIC COMORBIDITIES Many of these disorders have significant psychiatric comorbidities. Juvenile fibromyalgia is associated with anxiety disorders and major mood disorders. Children with medically unexplained symptoms generally have more anxiety and depression than children with other chronic disorders. Other associations include disruptive behaviors, symptom internalization, fearfulness, greater dependency, hyperactiv- ity, and concern about sickness. PREDISPOSING FACTORS Female gender and older age (adolescence) increase the risk of COPCs. Certain conditions (e.g., headache) are more common in males or have similar prevalence across genders during childhood, but the prevalence in females increases after puberty. Trauma or posttraumatic stress dis- order increases psychologic comorbidities in juvenile fibromyalgia. Some studies suggest that anxiety predisposes to chronic pain. A population-based study following children from 18 months to 14 years of age suggested that maternal psychologic distress in early childhood and depressive and pain complaints in preadolescence increase the risk of recurrent abdominal pain at age 14. Postinfectious IBS is an identifi- able risk factor for new-onset anxiety, depression, and sleep disruption in adults. Children with recurrent abdominal pain often have parents with abdominal pain. It is unclear if this association is caused by a com- mon environmental/genetic factor or a learned behavior of the child imitating the parent. NATURAL HISTORY The natural history of COPC is not well known. Chronic disabling fatigue in the general adolescent population persists 2-3 years in about 25% of patients, but only 8% of youth affected at age 13 still had the complaints at ages 16 and 18. A meta-analysis suggests that the prog- nosis of CFS in children is usually good, with a small minority having persistent disabling symptoms. The patient's belief in an underlying

Gastroenterology. 2011;140:91-100, Fig. 3.). physical disorder and the presence of psychiatric comorbidities predict a poorer outcome. In a study of children with FGID, the outcome depended on specific variables. Those who perceived their abdominal pain as more threaten- ing, with high levels of pain catastrophization and little capacity to cope with pain because of reduced activity levels, had a poorer outcome. This "high pain dysfunctional profile" subgroup was predominantly female (70%) with a mean age of 12.2 years. Two thirds of this subgroup still complained of FGID at follow-up vs about one third of those in the other groups. These groups included a "high pain adaptive profile" group with similar pain levels but better adaptive skills and less catastrophization, predominantly slightly younger (11.8 years) females, and a "low pain adaptive profile" group, slightly younger (11.1 years), with equal males and females but less abdominal pain, better coping mechanisms, and less impairment of daily activities. In the high pain dysfunctional profile group, 41% had both FGID and nonabdominal chronic pain at follow- up vs 11% in the high pain adaptive and 17% in the low pain adaptive group. Another study following children ages 4-16.6 years with IBS dem- onstrated resolution of symptoms in 58%, usually without medication. The differences between these studies may result from the age of the groups, with better outcome in the younger patients, as well as the number of comorbidities and psychologic profile. Similarly, in juvenile fibromyal- gia, symptoms are still present 2-6 years later in about 60% of affected children. The psychiatric comorbidities, mainly depression, and control- ling family environments are associated with a poor prognosis. PROPOSED PATHOPHYSIOLOGY There may be dysfunction in the hypothalamic-hypophyseal-adrenal axis, circadian patterns, autonomic responses, some aspects of CNS processing, the inflammatory immune response, and the musculoskel- etal system. Vagal tone measured by heart rate variability is decreased in some children with FGID symptoms and in children with COPCs. Alterations in the autonomic nervous system may affect the immune system and circadian patterns. The stress response may increase mus- cle tone, which in turn leads to body aches and tension headaches. In fibromyalgia the cortisol response is altered, with lower cortisol levels 45 50 on awakening and throughout the day. Orthostatic intolerance from autonomic abnormalities may also contribute to poor concentration from brain hypoperfusion and blood pooling in the lower extremities. The pathophysiology has been better studied in myalgic encephalomyeli- tis (ME)/CFS. ME/CFS has been associated with joint hypermobility, ortho- static intolerance, decreased range of motion, and reduced activity. These patients demonstrate excessive glial activation resulting in neuroexcitation, neuroinflammation, and possibly neurodegeneration. These features may contribute to the cognitive issues and fatigue present in this disorder. Neuroinflammation and other changes in processing may lead to abnormal descending inhibitory pain pathways, resulting in distal pain and "central sensitization." The malfunction of descending antinocicep- tive pathways allows pain to spread in the body, associated with increased activity of the nociceptive facilitator pathways. These facilitator pathways are further activated by psychologic factors, such as catastrophization, depression, lack of acceptance, and hypervigilance. Other signals such as pressure, sound, heat, and cold are also aberrantly processed, with activation of areas of the brain that are typically activated only by acute pain stimuli, such as the insula, prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as some regions usually not involved in pain processing. The neuromechanisms involved in dysregulated brain-gut interactions in patients with FGID include changes in functional connectivity between brain regions associated with nociceptive processing and the somato- sensory cortexes. Enhanced sensory processing of the gut homeostasis (homeostatic afferent) and attentive responses to salience stimuli (salience network) as well as changes in certain brain regions are noted in patients with FGID (Fig. 212.1). These alterations affect the perception of pain and may affect the endocrine and autonomic nervous systems. What was once called FGIDs is currently considered disorders of gut-brain interactions. Proposed mechanisms are noted in Figure 212.2. Research investigat- ing the role of the microbiome in regulating microglia, astrocytes, and immune cells may lead to central sensitization and chronic pain. TREATMENT In general, chronic pain should never be treated with opioids; cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) and a gradually progressive exercise program

The brain-gut-microbial axis: A framework for understanding functional Gl illness and their therapeutic interventions. Eur J Int Med. 2021;84:1-9, Fig. 2.) constitute the cornerstones of treatment. The complex comorbid nature of COPCs typically requires a multidisciplinary approach. Because neither CBT nor exercise will have any effect in the absence of full patient engagement and understanding, the team must include the family and the patient, a pain psychologist with experience in CBT, a physical therapist, and the primary care physician. Depending on comorbid conditions, rheumatology, neurology, or gastroenterol- ogy may have important roles for symptom management and a pos- sible alternative diagnosis. Depending on the initial symptomatology, the differential diagnosis should include inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythema- tosus, dermatomyositis, autoinflammatory disorders, Fabry disease, porphyrias, hereditary sensory-autonomic neuropathies, and Ehlers- Danlos syndrome. Red flags suggesting a medical/organic etiology for abdominal pain (Table 212.1), headache (Tables 212.2 and 212.3), and musculoskeletal pain (Table 212.4) must be assessed. When a thorough evaluation for a structural cause of symptoms is unrevealing, an important next step is patient and family education. This should include the common presentation, the expectation that "mark- ers" for these types of disorders would typically be absent, and the pres- ence of solid management tools with high probability of improvement. Families and patients need to receive encouragement to stop seeking a "magic diagnosis and cure" and to begin the path to full recovery. With- out this step, critical patient engagement in the treatment will not occur. In our practice, we sometimes call functional disorders a problem of "software" in contrast to structural issues that would involve "hardware." We explain that successful management must change the software, not just mask symptoms. Approaches that accomplish such a goal include CBT and a rehabilitative program that may require physical therapy, a vigorous exercise program with interval training, meditation, and/ or yoga. Patients are often deconditioned and may need to start with a very low level of physical activity. In addition, their exercise tolerance may be significantly hampered by an orthostatic intolerance syndrome (e.g., POTS). For these reasons, we frequently recommend starting with a water aerobics program, which provides several benefits: (1) very low gravitational force, so the patient can be set up for success, working only on conditioning and not simultaneously fighting an orthostatic chal- lenge; (2) builds both limb and core strength; and (3) gentle on joints for those with arthralgias or a hypermobility syndrome. When water is unavailable, we recommend starting with a recumbent exercise program such as a recumbent stationary bike. In both circumstances, we then slowly introduce upright aerobic activities on land over 2-3 months. Strength exercises are also useful. A Cochrane review in adults with painful disorders showed exercise to have minimal side effects and to improve functionality, reduce pain, and improve quality of lite. Patients with fibromyalgia who undergo a 3-month multidisciplinary program with twice-weekly physical therapy and CBT benefited in function and physical activity level, and most importantly continued to exercise regu- larly at 1 year follow-up. Pharmacologic interventions have less impact than nonmedical treatments. When children are missing school or are homebound, it is important to work closely with the school to encourage reentry. This may require modifying the school schedule initially, starting with fewer hours at school, and providing extra time for homework on days that the chil- dren are not feeling well. Although medications such as tricyclic antidepressants are often added to the treatment, the improvement with these medications for chronic pain is minimal, and the side effects need to be considered. Nonetheless, amitriptyline and anticonvulsants like gabapentin are often used because they help in treating headaches and abdominal pain and improve sleep quality, a critical element to manage any chronic pain condition.

Magnusson Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encepha- lomyelitis (ME), is a complex, diverse, and debilitating illness char- acterized by chronic or intermittent fatigue accompanied by select symptoms and occurring in children, adolescents, and adults. The combination of fatigue and other symptoms interferes significantly with daily activities and has no identified medical explanation (Fig. 212.3). The fatigue does not require exertion by the patient, nor does rest relieve it. Some consider postexertion malaise, or worsening of

A definitive causal agent or process has not been identified, although the differential diag- nosis includes infectious, inflammatory, metabolic, genetic, and auto- immune diseases. Our understanding of this condition is largely from studies of adults and adolescents, with limited descriptions of chronic fatiguing illnesses in younger children.

(From Unger ER, Lin JMS, Brimmer DJ, et al. CDC Grand Rounds: Chronic fatigue syndrome-advancing research and clinical education. MMWR. 2016;65(50-51]:1434-1438.) The illness was formally defined in 1988 as chronic fatigue syn- drome because persistent unexplained fatigue was considered the principal and invariable physical symptom. A variety of other names have been used to describe the illness, including chronic mononucleosis, chronic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, postin- fection syndrome, and immune dysfunction syndrome. Several case definitions have been developed and are in use in both clinical care and research (Table 212.5). The Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2015 recommendations apply to all ages and include a special focus on pediatrics. The IOM sug- gested new diagnostic criteria and a new name, systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), to emphasize the postexertion malaise criterion and better understand the illness (Table 212.6). EPIDEMIOLOGY Based on worldwide studies, 0.2-2.3% of adolescents or children have CFS. Most epidemiology studies use the 1994 definition. CFS is more prevalent in adolescents than in younger children. The vari- ation in CFS prevalence estimates may result from variations in case definition, study methodology and application, study population composition (specialty vs general practice or general population), and data collection (parent, self-reporting vs clinician evaluation). Gender distribution in children differs from that in adults, with a more equal distribution in children <15 years old, while remaining two-fold to three-fold higher in females 15-18 years old. Few stud- ies have reported the incidence of CFS among children <10 years old. In adolescents in the Netherlands, the pediatrician-diagnosed incidence of CFS/ME was 0.01%, and in the United Kingdom, 0.5%. PATHOGENESIS Although the etiology and pathophysiology of CFS are unknown, some patients and clinicians correlate the onset with a recent epi- sode of a viral illness such as infectious mononucleosis (10-12%) (EBV; see Chapter 301). A pathophysiologic relationship of CFS to infection is suggested because the symptoms and biologic markers elicited by the nonspecific innate host responses to infections in general are present in CFS. CFS-like illness after infectious mono- nucleosis is not predicted by viremia or altered host response to EBV infection, but is associated with the severity of the primary infection. A wide variety of other candidate viral infections have been associated with postinfectious fatigue syndromes, particu- larly in adolescents and adults. SARS CoV-2/COVID-19 infection has also been implicated, as patients with a history of COVID-19 infection have presented with symptoms similar to patients with ME/CFS, labeled long COVID, post-acute sequalae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC), or post-COVID-19 conditions (Table 212.7) (see

Similar features have been described in post-inten- sive care syndrome. Similarities between CFS symptoms and those experienced by patients with autoimmune and other inflammatory disorders sug gests primary perturbation of immune function in the pathogenesis of CFS. Hypogammaglobulinemia and hypergammaglobulinemia, immunoglobulin subclass deficiencies, elevated levels of circulating immune complexes, altered helper/suppressor lymphocyte ratios, natural killer cell dysfunction, elevated cytokines, and monocyte dysfunction have been inconsistently reported in adult patients with CFS. These findings have not been consistent among studies. CFS patients as a group differ from healthy controls, but most labo- ratory values of the immune parameters are not outside the normal range. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) changes are suggested by the orthostatic intolerance (OI) experienced by some patients with CFS. OI syndromes with circulatory dysfunction include neutrally mediated hypotension and POTS and have been observed in some patients with CFS and could contribute to the syndrome. The patho- physiology of these manifestations among adolescents with CFS is unclear, but in postinfectious states could be associated with unre- plenished fluid and electrolyte losses associated with acute infection or immune-mediated injury (autoantibodies directed against ANS). Because the widespread musculoskeletal pain in CFS is similar to fibro- myalgia, and because some consider these to be overlapping syndromes, fibromyalgia and CFS may share similarities in pathogenesis. Other hypotheses under investigation for the biologic basis of CFS involve altera- tions in energy metabolism (e.g., mitochondrion, particularly as related to exercise intolerance and postexertion malaise), alterations in sleep, the stress response, and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Understanding CFS has proved so challenging because it likely represents more than one underlying pathophysiology. Current studies and guidelines are attempt- 

1580 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS The dominant symptom expressed by adolescents and adults is a substantial reduction or impairment in the ability to engage in pre- illness levels of activity, accompanied by fatigue (see Fig. 212.2). In younger children, who often do not spontaneously report symp- toms, exertion induces behavioral changes, manifested by a lack of their usual energy and reduced participation in activities. In adoles- cents, fatigue and postexertion malaise may lead to decreased par- ticipation in school, family activities, and social exchange. Cognitive impairment includes reported difficulties in concen- trating, which are common and indicated by reduced participa- tion in school, difficulty keeping up with homework, and a drop in grades. Sleep may be impaired, and nonrestorative sleep is com- mon. Other sleep complaints include difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, whereas diagnosed sleep disorders, including rest- less legs syndrome, parasomnias, and sleep apnea, are less com- mon. Myalgia and arthralgia may accompany fatigue and altered sleep. Sore throat and cervical lymph node tenderness can occur but may be part of an inciting illness. Adolescents also have increased reports of headache, abdominal pain, nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound with amplified pain. Patients diagnosed with CFS in primary care practices are more likely to report abrupt onset of their symptoms, often as part of an initial virus-like illness, whereas gradual onset is more common in those identified in population-based studies. School absenteeism is a major social issue. In one study, two thirds of adolescents missed >2 weeks over a 6-week observation period, and one third required home tutoring. Unlike school phobia, inactivity due to CFS persists on the weekends and during holidays the same as it does during the school week. Although fatigue and accompanying symptoms are subjective, the magnitude of impairment of each component can be measured by questionnaires addressing pain and function or, in the case of sus- pected orthostatic instability, by recording routine supine and stand- ing heart rate and blood pressure measurements. Fatigue cannot be dismissed as a minor ailment. It generally manifests as lassitude, profound tiredness, intolerance of exertion with easy fatigability, and general malaise. Abnormal physical examination findings are conspicuously absent, providing both reassurance and consternation for the patient, family, and physician. The presence of "alarm symptoms" such as weight loss, chest pain with exertion, paresthesia, dry mouth and eyes, fevers, diar- rhea, cough, night sweats, and rash is uncommon and warrants consid- eration of a diagnosis other than CFS.

The diagnosis is clinically defined based on inclusion and exclusion cri- teria (Fig. 212.4). The diagnostic criteria are applicable to adults and adolescents >11 years old because of the current requirement for a self-generated history. Whereas duration of symptoms is 3-6 months depending on age, symptom management should not wait until this criterion is met. CFS is difficult to diagnose in children, who may have difficulty describing their symptoms and articulating their concerns. Sole reliance on parental history can be fraught with confusion because parents may also struggle to interpret their children's symptoms and feelings in providing accurate historical information. A combina- tion of child and parent reporting is most effective. It is important to document the child's activity levels and worsening of symptoms after physical or mental endeavors. Changes in participation in hobbies and family or other social activities can help identify the impact of CFS on function. The diagnosis of CFS can be established only after other medi- cal and psychiatric causes of fatigue and other symptoms, many of which are treatable, have been excluded. These include medical con- ditions presenting with chronic symptoms, such as hypothyroidism, Fig. 212.4 Diagnostic algorithm for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chron- ic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ANS, autonomic nervous system; HPA, hypothalamic-pituitary axis. (From Institute of Medicine. Beyond Myal- gic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: National Academies Press; 2015.) adrenal insufficiency, respiratory and food allergies, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, substance abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder, adverse drug reactions, and obesity. A previously diagnosed medical con- dition with incomplete or uncertain resolution that may explain fatigue needs be considered Certain illnesses (e.g., fibromyalgia), amplified pain syndrome, post-COVID-19 condition, post-intensive care syndrome, and depression share similar symptoms with CFS but are not exclusion- ary diagnoses. These should be considered in the differential diag- nosis in select cases. There is concern that CFS might be mistaken for readily identifiable psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and mood disorders, but evidence supports differences in their clinical presentation from CFS. CFS should not be diagnosed in persons with a prior diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic or melancholic features, bipolar affective disorders, schizophrenia 

Chapter 213 • Miscellaneous Conditions Associated with Arthritis 1581 of any subtype, delusional disorders of any subtype, dementia of any subtype, eating disorder of any type, or alcohol or other substance abuse within 2 years before the onset of the chronic fatigue or any time thereafter. Although evaluation of each patient should be individualized, initial laboratory evaluation should be limited to screening labo- ratory testing sufficient to provide reassurance of the lack of sig- nificant medical illness. Further evaluation should be directed primarily toward excluding treatable illnesses that may be suggested by the history, symptoms, signs, or physical exam findings present in specific patients. MANAGEMENT Management of CFS is based on relief of the core and most disrup- tive symptoms in the individual patient. The diagnostic criterion of 6 months duration of illness should not delay evaluation and symp- tom management, because these may be initiated as soon as the child or adolescent presents with a CFS-like picture. Problems with sleep can be addressed by encouraging patients to adopt good sleep habits using standard sleep hygiene techniques. It may be beneficial to refer the patient to a sleep medicine specialist for the identifica- tion and treatment of sleep disorders and disturbances. Once pain is found not to be related to other specific disease or illness, nonphar- macologic treatment is indicated. One of the nonpharmacologic approaches to pain management, CBT, may also assist the patient in managing and coping with CFS. Through explanation and changes in perception of the illness, CBT may help patients and their families develop coping skills and pro- vide emotional support. Improved methods of coping may allow some improved function while living with the illness. Comorbid psychiatric conditions such as anxiety require appropriate evaluation and inter- vention. Guided graded-exercise therapy may be beneficial and added Although the overall goal is to help patients with CFS tolerate activity, children and adolescents with CFS should limit physical or mental efforts that result in aggravated symptoms. Return to school should be initiated gradually and systematically with the goal to return to full-time attendance. Home tutoring, cyber-school, and partial attendance can be interim steps. Parents and clinicians can work with teachers and school administrators to define appropriate expectations for attendance and performance for children with CFS. Because of the crucial importance of learning socialization skills, even brief attendance in school or participation in school activities should be encouraged, remembering that too rapid remobilization usually exacerbates symptoms and should be avoided. Continued empathy and support by the treating physician are cru- cial in maintaining a physician-parent-patient relationship that is con- ducive to managing this illness. Careful attention must be directed to family dynamics to identify and resolve family problems or psycho- pathology that may be contributing to children's perception of their The natural history of CFS is highly variable, and patients and fami- lies understand that the symptoms will wax and wane. Children and adolescents with CFS appear to have a more optimistic outcome than adults, typically with an undulating course of gradual improvement over several years. Overall, a good functional outcome has been reported in up to 80% of patients. Poor prognostic factors include gradual onset, increased school absenteeism, lower socioeconomic status, chronic maternal health problems, and untreated comorbid individual and family psychiatric disorders. Favorable prognostic factors include patient control of the rehabilitation program, with continuing support from health professionals and family members, and improvement in orthostatic intolerance.

Egla Rabinovich RELAPSING POLYCHONDRITIS Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare condition characterized by episodic chondritis causing cartilage destruction and deformation of the ears (spar- ing the earlobes), nose, larynx, and tracheobronchial tree. Antibodies to matrillin- 1 and collagen (types II, IX, and XI) are present in approximately 60% of patients with RP, suggesting an autoimmune pathogenesis. Patients may experience arthritis, uveitis, and hearing loss resulting from inflam- mation near the auditory and vestibular nerves. Children may initially relate episodes of intense erythema over the outer ears. Other dermatologic manifestations may include erythema nodosum, maculopapular rash, and purpura. Cardiac involvement, including conduction defects and coronary vasculitis, has been reported. Severe, progressive, and potentially fatal dis- ease resulting from destruction of the tracheobronchial tree and airway obstruction is unusual in childhood. Diagnostic criteria established for adults are useful guidelines for evaluating children with suggestive symp- toms (Table 213.1). The clinical course of RP is variable; flares of disease are often associated with elevations of acute-phase reactants and may remit spontaneously. Although seen more often in the adult population, RP may coexist with other rheumatic disease (eg., systemic lupus erythe- matosus, Sjögren syndrome, Henoch-Schönlein purpura) in up to 30% of patients. The differential diagnosis includes ANCA-associated vasculitis granulomatosis with polyangiitis) (see Chapter 210.4) and Cogan syn- drome, which is characterized by auditory nerve inflammation and kera- titis but not chondritis. MAGIC (mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage) syndrome has many similarities to Behçet disease (see Chapter 202). A genetic syndrome named vacuoles, El enzyme, X-linked, autoin- flammatory, somatic (VEXAS) syndrome is caused by somatic pathogenic variants affecting the UBA1 gene. Adolescent and adult patients (most are male) with this syndrome may have fevers, myalgia, arthralgia, auricular chondritis, and erythema nodosum. Approximately 50% of patients with VEXAS meet criteria for relapsing polychondritis. Between 5% and 10% of patients originally thought to have RP have pathogenic variants in UBA1. Affected patients have a high CRP and ESR in addition to lower platelet counts when compared with patients with only RP. Many children respond to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, but some require corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents Table 213.1 Suggested Criteria for Relapsing Polychondritis* MAJOR Typical inflammatory episodes of ear cartilage Typical inflammatory episodes of nose cartilage Typical inflammatory episodes of laryngotracheal cartilage MINOR Eye inflammation (conjunctivitis, keratitis, episcleritis, uveitis) Hearing loss Vestibular dysfunction Seronegative inflammatory arthritis *The diagnosis Histal lie ay the pre diate of ele milar is erad are tro presentation is atypical.

1582 Part XIV • Rheumatic Diseases of Childhood (Connective Tissue Disease, Collagen Vascular Diseases) Fig. 213.1 Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA). Symmet- ric, oval and round, reddish brown macular, papular, necrotic, and crusted lesions on the chest of 9-yr-old boy. (From Paller AS, Mancini AJ, eds. Hur- witz Clinical Pediatric Dermatology, 5th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2016: Fig. 4-33, p. 87.) (azathioprine, methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, cyclo- phosphamide, cyclosporine, and anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents), as reported in small series and case reports. MUCHA-HABERMANN DISEASE/PITYRIASIS LICHENOIDES ET VARIOLIFORMIS ACUTA Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) is a benign, self- limited cutaneous vasculitis characterized by episodes of macules, papules, and papulovesicular lesions that can develop central ulceration, necrosis, and crusting (Fig. 213.1). Different stages of development are usually seen at once. PLEVA fulminans or febrile ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease (FUMHD) is the severe, life-threatening form of PLEVA. Large, coalescing, ulceronecrotic lesions are seen, accompanied by high fever and elevated ESR. Systemic manifestations can include interstitial pneumonitis, abdominal pain, malabsorption, arthritis, and neurologic manifestations. PLEVA has a male predominance and occurs more frequently in childhood. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy of skin lesions, which reveals perivas- cular and intramural lymphocytic inflammation affecting capillaries and venules in the upper dermis that may lead to keratinocyte necrosis. Pho- totherapy has been used in some cases of PLEVA. When disease is severe, corticosteroids have been used with questionable effect, and methotrexate has been reported to induce rapid remission in resistant cases. Cyclospo- rine and anti-TNF agents have also been efficacious in case reports. SWEET SYNDROME Sweet syndrome, or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a rare entity in children. It is characterized by fever, elevated neutrophil count, and raised, tender erythematous plaques and nodules over the face, extremities, and trunk. Skin biopsy reveals neutrophilic perivas- cular infiltration in the upper dermis. Female predominance is seen in the adult population, whereas gender distribution is equal in children. Established criteria are useful for diagnosis (Table 213.2). Children can also have arthritis, multifocal nonbacterial osteomyelitis, myositis, and other extracutaneous manifestations. Sweet syndrome may be idiopathic or secondary to malignancy (particularly acute myelogenous leukemia), drugs (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, tretinoin, azathioprine, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), or rheumatic diseases (Behcet disease antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus). It has also been reported in association with COVID-19, VEXAS, CAN- DLE (chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature), Majeed syndrome, and deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) and pyrin associated autoinflammation with neutrophilic dermatosis (PAAND) syndromes (see Chapter 204). The condition usually responds to treatment with corticosteroids, treat- ment of underlying disease, or removal of the associated medication. HYPERTROPHIC OSTEOARTHROPATHY Children with chronic disease, especially pulmonary or cardiac disease, can demonstrate clubbing of the terminal phalanges and have associated Table 213.2 Diagnostic Criteria for Classic Sweet Syndrome* MAJOR CRITERIA Abrupt onset of painful erythematous plaques or nodules Histopathologic evidence of dense neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis MINOR CRITERIA Pyrexia >38°C Association with underlying hematologic or visceral malignancy, inflammatory disease, or pregnancy or preceded by an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection or vaccination Excellent response to systemic corticosteroids or potassium iodide Abnormal laboratory values at presentation (three of four): Erythrocyte sedimentation rate >20 mm/hr Positive C-reactive protein test result >8,000 leukocytes/mm3 >70% neutrophils/mm3 *The diagnosis is established by the presence of two major criteria plus two of the four minor criteria.

HOA can be pri- mary (idiopathic) or secondary. Although rare, secondary HOA is more common in children and is seen in those with chronic pulmonary disease (cystic fibrosis), congenital heart disease, gastrointestinal disease (mal- absorption syndromes, biliary atresia, inflammatory bowel disease), and malignancy (nasopharyngeal sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Hodgkin disease). It may precede a diagnosis of cardiopulmonary disease or malignancy. The pathogenesis of secondary HOA is unknown; symptoms often improve if the underlying condition is treated successfully. HOA-related pain can be disabling; in adults, management with bisphosphonates has been reported. Evaluation of children presenting with HOA should include a chest radio- graph to evaluate for pulmonary disease or intrathoracic mass. Autosomal recessive pathogenic variants in prostaglandin pathway genes have been described in primary HOA, also described as pachydermoperiostosis. PLANT THORN SYNOVITIS A diagnosis of plant thorn synovitis should be considered in children with monoarticular arthritis nonresponsive to antiinflammatory therapy. Acute or chronic arthritis can occur after a plant thorn or other foreign object penetrates a joint. Unlike septic arthritis, children with plant thorn synovi- tis are usually afebrile. The most common organism seen with plant thorn synovitis is Pantoea agglomerans, although cultures are often negative. The initial injury may be unknown or forgotten, making the diagnosis difficult. Ultrasound or MRI can be useful in identifying the foreign body. Removal of the foreign body using arthroscopy, followed by an antibiotic course, is the accepted therapy. PIGMENTED VILLONODULAR SYNOVITIS Proliferation of synovial tissue is seen in pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS). This proliferation is localized or diffuse and can affect the joint, tendon sheath, or bursa. Macrophages and multinucleated giant cells with brownish hemosiderin are present histologically. It is unclear if the etiology of PVNS is inflammatory or neoplastic in nature. Although findings are not pathognomonic, MRI with contrast is a useful diagnostic tool by which PVNS can be seen as a mass or bone erosion. Brown or bloody synovial fluid is seen with arthrocentesis, but the diagnosis is made by tissue biopsy. Surgical removal of the affected tissue is the therapeutic modality, and with diffuse disease, a total synovectomy is recommended.
